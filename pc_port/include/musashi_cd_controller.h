 * and lead-out metadata. Invalid parameters refuse before command acceptance;
 * hardware error packets, media-changing and audio-producing commands remain
 * unsupported. Command latency remains the declared 0x800-cycle source model.

 * Pause09 and SeekL15 (SeekL retires the ReadN buffers). Setloc/Setmode do
 * not cancel an active ReadN. A new read retires idle prior buffers at ACK;
 * an active DMA view refuses retirement. Unread bytes are not consumption.
 * A0 exposes2340 bytes; C0 data sectors expose2048 payload bytes.
 * C0 XA audio/realtime sectors use the bound PCM sink for4-bit stereo37800Hz;
 * missing sinks and other XA coding formats refuse.
 * Seek requires Setloc/A0-or-C0 and actual data_transfer_idle capability. At ACK it
 * retires all old data views without consumption; completion validates the
 * actual mounted target header at ACK+1806336, then commits position/INT2.
 * ACK snapshots pre-seek status; BUSYSTS clears while seeking remains set.

 * These are declared native timings, not physical seek/bus-cycle parity.
 * One arriving, one announced and one requested real-byte buffer: INT1 may
 * announce a newer sector while requested bytes remain locked. Request00
 * releases that view; the next80 copies the announced bytes and resets cursor.
 * Repeated80 preserves the requested identity/cursor. Announcement alone does
 * not set fifo_valid/DRQ. An unclaimed announcement is retained across ACK;
 * required incoming overwrite faults rather than emulating hardware skipping.
