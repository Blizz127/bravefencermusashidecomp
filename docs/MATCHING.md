# Matching log and method

## Status

One function is byte-verified against retail. The original compiler is still
**unresolved**, and the first match did nothing to change that — see the
non-discrimination result below, which is the more important finding.

| vram | words | source | verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0x80012AB0` | 3/3 | `src/main/80012ab0.c` | MATCH |

Reproduce with:

```sh
python3 tools/build_candidate.py src/main/80012ab0.c \
  --symbol func_80012AB0 \
  --toolchain gcc-2.7.2-psx \
  --toolchain-root "$PSYQ_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT" \
  --maspsx "$PSYQ_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT/maspsx/maspsx.py" \
  --output /tmp/candidate.bin
python3 tools/match_function.py --vram 0x80012AB0 --size 0xC --candidate /tmp/candidate.bin
```

## A match is not a compiler identification

The first matched function was compiled against every locally available
toolchain at three optimization levels and two `-G` values. **All 18
configurations produced byte-identical output:**

| toolchain | `-O1` | `-O2` | `-O3` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gcc-2.6.0-psx` | MATCH | MATCH | MATCH |
| `gcc-2.7.2-psx` | MATCH | MATCH | MATCH |
| `gcc-2.7.2-cdk-psx` | MATCH | MATCH | MATCH |

(`-G0` and `-G8` agree throughout.)

A three-instruction arithmetic leaf has exactly one sensible encoding, so its
codegen is invariant across compiler versions and optimization levels. It
proves the build and comparison pipeline works. It is worth **zero** evidence
about which toolchain built the game.

The practical consequence: **discriminating functions must be selected
deliberately, not stumbled into.** A function only carries version evidence if
candidate toolchains actually disagree on it. Before treating any future match
as toolchain evidence, compile it against the full candidate set and confirm
the alternatives *fail*. A match that every candidate reproduces is a pipeline
test, not a fingerprint.

Properties that make a function likely to discriminate:

- enough live values to force register allocation choices
- a non-trivial return path, so return-delay-slot behaviour is exercised
- division or modulo, whose expansion varies by ASPSX version
- `-G`-sensitive access to small globals, which changes `$gp` addressing
- floating point, which becomes libgcc calls under `-msoft-float`

## Caveat on the return-delay-slot heuristic

Commit `915c6fe` recorded a 17.81% return-slot fill rate and cited the rule
that GCC 2.8.1 fills the slot after `jr $ra` while 2.7.2 does not. A trivial
leaf compiled here with `gcc-2.7.2-psx` **did** fill its return slot, and the
matched `0x80012AB0` has its `andi` scheduled into the delay slot in retail
too.

So the rule is not a flat property of the compiler. When the slot is trivially
fillable, 2.7.2 fills it. The heuristic only carries signal where scheduling is
genuinely constrained, which means the 17.81% aggregate cannot be read as
"mostly 2.7.2" without segregating functions by scheduling difficulty first.

## Operational note

`argparse` rejects an option value that looks like a flag, so the optimization
and `-G` arguments must use the `=` form:

```sh
--optimization=-O2 --gp=-G0      # correct
--optimization -O2               # error: expected one argument
```
