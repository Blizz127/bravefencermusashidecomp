"""Re-decompile the unverified drafts that do not compile, and only those.

A draft that does not compile can never reach the oracle, so it is dead
weight: `batch_match.py --register-existing` reports `build-failed` and
moves on. Most of those failures had one cause. m2c, run in its default
mode, spells an access into an untyped global `NAME.unkHHHH`, while the
sanitizer has already had to declare NAME a plain scalar, so the retail
compiler rejects the member access. `--valid-syntax` emits the same access
as M2C_FIELD carrying the width m2c inferred, which compiles.

This tool is deliberately narrow, because the sources it edits are checked
work:

* A function already in the registry is never touched.
* A body that does not carry the UNVERIFIED draft marker is never touched.
  A verified match, a hand-written body, and an assembly overlay all stay
  exactly as they are.
* A draft that already compiles is never touched. Being close enough to
  build is progress; replacing it with a fresh guess would throw that away.
* The `MUSASHI_NATIVE_MIPS_WORD_EXPORT` block is copied across verbatim and
  compared word for word afterwards. Those words feed the native seam
  through tools/extract_asm_words.py, and a changed count fails the build.
* A regenerated body that still does not compile is discarded, leaving the
  original file on disk.

Nothing here claims a match. Every file it writes is still an unverified
draft; only tools/match_function.py can promote one.
