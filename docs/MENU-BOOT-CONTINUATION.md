# Native menu continuation — 2026-09-08

## Start-screen visual result

Run68 naturally reaches the rendered start screen. The desktop capture
`artifacts/bfm-takeover-20260907/boot-68/window-13.png` shows the retail logo,
**PUSH START BUTTON**, and **© 1998 SQUARE**. The 1280x960 image is centered,
with equal top/bottom bars and no bottom crop. No guest PC, menu flag, or Start
input was forced to obtain that capture. This establishes visible start-screen
output, not gameplay, physical timing parity, or attract-mode completion.

The natural idle transition subsequently refuses at unexported800CF300. The
explicit `tools/run_native_menu_preview.sh` launcher is intended to stop host
execution after natural start-screen frames and retain that rendered window for
inspection. Its window title labels the paused preview; close the window to exit.
It uses the existing `build/menu-takeover` binary and local extracted retail media.
A normal launch without `MUSASHI_PAUSE_AT_START_SCREEN=1` remains unpaused.

The final focused suite passes57 tests. Run70 exposed a further host catch-up
race: the previous bound delivered a sector one cycle before its successor's
deadline. ReadS now cuts at the delivered sector's own deadline so its callback
has the full guest transfer period. The scheduler regression checks this explicitly.
Run72 verifies the persistent paused preview: the naturally rendered start
screen is held after34 menu iterations while the source's blinking prompt is
visible. The live desktop capture is
`artifacts/bfm-takeover-20260907/boot-72/start-screen-centered.png`.
The window is labeled "Brave Fencer Musashi - start screen preview (paused)".
It is left open for inspection; closing it ends the preview. No guest state was
changed to choose the visible blink phase. The final suite passes57 tests.

## Earlier continuation — 2026-09-08, runs 40–58

The start menu remains **NOT_REACHED**. The old desktop game process is closed.
The source-loaded member-4 route and centered scanout remain in use; no automatic
Start input or host movie-completion flag is enabled.

The CD stream callback and DMA3 completion path now execute their actual retail
instruction exports. DMA byte writes drive the shifted full source register,
DMA3 sync-mode-0 ignores BCR's upper count, and the observed chopped mode consumes
one word per native deadline with the configured CPU gaps. Completion follows
actual FIFO consumption. The source header and rectangle copies now support their
checked LWL/LWR/SWL/SWR sequences, including interleaved load-delay retirement.

Mode-C0 XA sectors are decoded to PCM and routed through the CD volume matrix into
the SPU queue, without publishing a data INT1. Four real sectors match FFmpeg's
37,800 Hz ADPCM output exactly. The documented resampler has an independent
convolution check; physical initial phase and exact hardware rounding remain
unverified. The combined XA/CD tests pass five cases.

Run49 reaches the movie VLC decompressor. Trapping ADD now checks signed overflow;
its SUB sites retain overflow refusal. The exact movie COP0 read/write sites are
admitted, and their SwC bit is retained by the status owner. PSX-SPX documents no
observable PSX cache effect for SwC. The CPU checks pass eight tests.

Run52 reaches MDEC command 3A001280. The new color decoder consumes actual RLE
parameters, uploaded quantization and scale tables, performs integer IDCT and
YUV conversion, and provides reordered color pixels to DMA1. The native model
buffers a complete input command, caps output at 1024 macroblocks, and uses
1+word-count transfer deadlines. It does not claim physical bus timing or exact
hardware numeric rounding. Monochrome and direct CPU output reads remain refused.
Tests verify DC quadrant placement, real deferred DMA output, and all 64 positive
and negative IDCT basis vectors against an independent cosine transform.

Run55 completes 86 MDEC transfers and captures real movie imagery in
`boot-55/frame.png` (converted losslessly from the native framebuffer PPM).
A live-window capture raced process exit, so this image is framebuffer evidence,
not a fresh desktop screenshot. Rectangle merge tests pass. The stream then stalls
because an acknowledged but ignored data announcement blocks all later INT1s.
ReadS now permits replacement of that announcement while preserving any separately
latched FIFO and outstanding IRQ/response. The regression uses real sector bytes;
three CD sector tests, including semantic mutants, pass. ReadN behavior is retained.

Run57 reaches the nested stream status-worker path after that fix. Run58 admits
its exact five-frame source ancestry; subsequent behavior is pending observation.
Run56's later member-4 helper CFFEC is still unexported and may be encountered
again after movie playback. Continue the natural route and verify the actual menu.

### Streaming timing and visible-output follow-up — runs 59–66

Live movie output is captured in `boot-64/window-3.png`: the 1280x960 window
has equal 40-pixel black bars above and below, with no bottom crop. This is a
fresh desktop capture, superseding the framebuffer-only observation above.

Host catch-up during the CD interrupt caused repeated ready callbacks. The movie
IRQ now limits sector production to instruction cost, while DMA retains its
absolute native clock. An active chopped transfer protects its FIFO until it
finishes. ReadS production also waits when fewer than 2352 pending PCM slots are
available. These are explicit native scheduling choices, not physical timing
parity. The extracted native scheduler test checks pending publication, ignored
ReadS announcements, instruction-cost pacing, active DMA, and PCM backpressure.

A transport underrun can leave silence already rendered by the SPU. Arriving XA
PCM is queued intact at the next available sample and subsequent blocks retain
that contiguous anchor. `XA_UNDERRUN` reports the gap; the queue test verifies no
samples are dropped, ordering is retained, and timestamp overflow is refused.
The audio queue size itself is unchanged. Audibility and audiovisual sync still
need human verification.

The exact nested stream ready-callback guard has positive and negative ancestry,
stack, argument, and live-slot tests. The movie-only stack bound is 0x200 bytes;
other CD callback bounds remain 0x178. Source exports and selectors pass40 tests.
Device checks pass14 tests, and the later PCM queue test passes separately.

Runs63/65 complete361 MDEC transfers, return from the movie, and resume opening
state setup. CFFEC–D0100, CF3E8–CFB3C, and CFC1C–CFE00 are now exported from the
same source-loaded member4 and retain instruction identity checks. Run66 is the
next observation. The start menu is still unverified; continue until it is visible.

## Corrected opening route — 2026-09-07, runs 25–29

The earlier SC01 route below was induced by an incorrect host overlay replacement
and automatic Start input. It is not evidence of reaching the menu. The retail
loader places MAIN.CD member 4 at 800CEDF8; the 9600-byte RAM capture in
`boot-25/overlay-before-host-load.bin` exactly matches member 4 at file offset
0x800. The old host loader overwrote it with member 7, then forced execution
addresses to compensate. Both the replacement and those PC redirects are removed.
Automatic Start is disabled by default. Member 4 now executes directly from its
source-selected instruction exports, checked against the actual loaded RAM.

Run 28 reaches 800D1E9C naturally and refuses the unadmitted routine. The next
exports cover 800D1E9C–800D24D0, including its initialization helpers. New archive
and selector tests verify member identity and every exported source word. The
actual menu remains **NOT_REACHED**. The image-centering fix below remains valid
and visually observed. No conflicting old game process remains running.

Run 31 confirms the next boundary: PC800D2D98 stores 80000000 to
1F801824 (v1), the MDEC reset/control register. The interpreter has no MDEC bus
binding. This is a device implementation gap, not another missing instruction
span. Do not bypass the write or fake movie completion. Source reference:
https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/macroblockdecodermdec/
Next work is source-backed MDEC reset/table/decode and DMA0/1 device support,
followed by natural boot. Added MAIN4 helper exports through D353C and EXE
helpers4657C,46B44,46C38,46D1C remain guarded/source-verified. Focused archive,
selector, source-export and GPU checks pass86 tests. Runs30/31 exit cleanly.

The shared Homebrew SDL2 header links disappeared during this continuation.
The installed sdl2-compat package is intact. The local build cache now points
SDL2_DIR directly to its Cellar/2.32.72/lib/cmake/SDL2; rebuild succeeds without
changing shared package links. Native boundary diagnostics now include v1.

### MDEC setup continuation — runs 32–35

The new MDEC controller accepts real reset, quantization/scale table commands,
and DMA0 request-mode table transfers. It owns the corresponding registers,
consumes actual guest RAM, and raises shared DMA completion only after transfer.
Absolute device time advances completion; polling reads do not advance it.
The 1+words timing is a native transport model, not physical cycle parity.
Decode commands and output DMA remain refused pending their implementation.

Run34 proves two table transfers completed naturally: command60000000,
remaining0, transfers2, control60000000, DMA0idle00000201. Execution then stops
at missing library helper8004689C. The next build includes that helper and its
source-backed callees. MAIN4's actual MDEC-output callback800D24D0 is admitted
on DMAchannel1 only while that overlay is selected. No menu/movie flags are set.
The reset/table/DMA test includes disabled-channel, pending-transfer, overrun,
reset-during-DMA, and unsupported-decode cases. Focused checks pass95 tests and
16 subtests before the latest additional library exports. Actual menu remains
NOT_REACHED. No game process is intentionally left running after diagnostics.

### Streaming CD mode — runs35–37

Run35 reaches Setmode(C0), refused by the A0-only drive. C0 requests double
speed, 2048-byte payloads, and XA audio. The drive now accepts that mode and
returns the actual Mode2 payload at raw offset24. Audio/realtime XA sectors
explicitly refuse until XA decoding is implemented; they never become data or
silently disappear. Source: https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/cdromdrive/

The new real-disc PVD test failed before this change and passes afterward,
including the existing zero-data and request-rewind negative controls. Five
CD/MDEC tests pass. A stale refusal test for Setmode while reading contradicted
the previously implemented LIST-owner behavior; it now checks unsupported C8
(filtered XA) instead. The LIST-owner acceptance test for active Setmode remains.
Run36 proceeds to movie-stream DMA3 callback registration800469CC. The next
build exports that actual handler and permits its registration while MAIN4 is
selected. Actual menu remains NOT_REACHED; MDEC pixel decoding and XA audio
are still implementation work, not external blockers.

### ReadS and paused-buffer restart — runs37–39

ReadS1B now uses the same successful-sector transport as ReadN06, retaining its
command identity for INT3/INT1. Error retry behavior remains unmodeled. The PVD
fixture covers both commands in modeC0. Run38 then proves a second root cause:
the prior paused read retains sector578 with only12 of2340 bytes consumed. A
new ReadS was rejected solely because this old requested view existed.

DuckStation BeginReading/BeginSeeking invokes ClearSectorBuffers. The native
owner now retires old views at new-read ACK, only with verified DMA idle, and
preserves actual consumed-byte counts. A real-disc pause/restart test fails
before and passes after; its busy-DMA negative control preserves the old view.
Source inspected: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stenzek/duckstation/master/src/core/cdrom.cpp
Five CD/MDEC checks (including two semantic mutants) pass. Run39 now successfully starts ReadS and publishes its first movie data sector
(LBA4657). The next refusal is the real CD-ready callback: IRQ call80045300
target80046610, which calls the already-exported stream handler80046D1C.
Next work: admit the source-backed stream callback and its validated call path
to the guarded CD IRQ executor, then continue through MDEC/XA decoding. No host overlay replacement or automatic Start input.

## Historical induced SC01 route — runs 16–21 (superseded)

Title asset loading completes: run16 reaches `80128158` with no exhausted IRQ
budget. The source file is **SC01.CD**, whose offset `0x800` exactly matches the
PAC header at disc LBA6162. Its compressed first sector at6163 independently
decodes to `artifacts/bfm-takeover-20260907/title-first-decoded.bin` (4516 bytes).
The code resembles MAIN member0012 but is a different overlay: at `801282AC`,
MAIN's word is `8C22E618`, while the live/independently decoded SC01 word is
`8C22EEA0`. New MAIN exports at80128158/80128288 preserve their existing matched
C and are guarded against the loaded RAM words. They execute the common prefix
then correctly refuse at801282AC. These SC01 observations are retained as historical decoding evidence; they do
not identify the natural menu route.

The user-reported image clipping is repaired and visually verified. The intro
uses640x480, but the display descriptor was reading only240 VRAM rows. GP1 mode
bits2+5 now double the field-height range for the full interlaced image. Other
mode combinations retain240 rows; returning to320x240 is covered. Reference:
https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/graphicsprocessingunitgpu/#gp108h-display-mode
This is full-frame host presentation, not proof of physical interlace fidelity.

Before: `boot-18/window.png` shows SQUARESOFT cut off at the bottom. After:
`boot-21/window-08.png` shows the entire centered logo; `window-05.png` shows the
complete publisher card. The logo's nonblack bounds are(304,448)-(978,510) in
1280x960, placing its center at(641,479). Captures were from the actual X11 game
window, not reconstructed VRAM. Window geometry was fully on-screen already.
The optional `MUSASHI_GPU_TRACE_PRIMITIVES` records drawing coordinates and
scanout dimensions; normal runs leave it disabled.

Validation:47 GPU-controller tests pass, including a regression that failed
before the height change.654 focused source/selector/IRQ-progress/GPU tests
pass (`latest-focused.log`). The real-disc LIST fixture, wrong-header negative
control, and nonterminating decoder control pass3 tests (`sector-irq-checks.log`).
Run21 exits at the guarded SC01 mismatch and removes all owned devices.
**Intro centering: OBSERVED. Actual game menu: NOT_REACHED.** No commit or push.

## Takeover checkpoint — 2026-09-07

The previous desktop writer was terminated and its processes verified gone.
The current continuation preserves its uncommitted work. Fresh evidence is in
`artifacts/bfm-takeover-20260907/`; runs 02–06 progressively execute the title
state dispatcher and its loader helpers. The former refused CD edge
`8001A6EC -> 80018714` now executes from pinned source words, followed by the
PAC decoder at `80018730`. A real-disc fixture checks the LBA 6162 PAC header
and all 4516 expanded bytes from LBA 6163 against an independent decoder.
The focused CD fixture passes; three negative controls reject missing destination
publication, an insufficient decoder budget, and a nonterminating copy loop.

Overlay 0007 and 0010 instruction selection refuses unmapped addresses instead
of falling through to overlay 0000. Compiled selector tests cover refusal and
every exported title word against retail bytes. The combined source-export and
selector checks pass **605 tests**. These results do not certify the whole suite.

Run 08 uses a separate RelWithDebInfo build in `build/menu-takeover` and still
retries at expected LBA 6165. Measured long callbacks take roughly 80 ms.
Retail code at `80019F04` retries after 300 incomplete polls; the cause of the
missing sector delivery remains under investigation. No device timing or sector
retirement semantics have been changed in response to this observation.
SIGTERM now requests an orderly diagnostic stop: run 08 reports `HOST_STOP`
and `OWNED_DEVICES removed=1`, with timeout exit 124. Run 09 adds optional
sector/FIFO diagnostics under `MUSASHI_NATIVE_CD_TIMING`.

Run 09 isolates a native scheduling defect: after the decoder claims LBA 6164,
LBA 6165 remains incoming with a pending publication deadline. The incoming
branch serviced only command deadlines, so publication waited until a retry
restored the default callback. The native scheduler now services an eligible
publication deadline through `advance_without_fetch`, preserving occupied-buffer
backpressure and the controller's acknowledgment rules. A compiled regression
using the production scheduling function fails before the change and passes
afterward; it also checks unclaimed announcements and unread IRQ/response state
remain blocked. The direct CD owner and log parser checks pass 19 tests.
Run 10 encounters an independent trailing-INT1 window: source `80044828`
records intended Pause before `8004482C` writes its command register. The INT1
guard now admits command 9 as well as ReadN/Setmode; the real-disc callback
fixture reproduces the former refusal and passes afterward.

Run 11 reaches LBA 6195 and exposes a decoder allowance incorrectly shared by
all sectors in one root IRQ. The 2,097,152 instruction decode limit now begins
at each guarded `80018730` call. Both insufficient-budget and infinite-copy
negative controls still reject. Run 12 then reaches the separate non-decoder
16,384-instruction allowance. The source root loops at `800452C4` to drain
additional sectors. Run 13 tests renewing that allowance only after a guarded
decoder return proves strictly advancing, contiguous output within 2 MiB RAM
and consecutive source sector identities. No-progress loops retain their
existing bound. Compiled progress-guard tests cover stationary/backward output,
repeated/skipped sectors, discontinuous destination and address overflow.

**Latest checkpoint: run 14.** The root reaches the image-upload phase around
LBA 6318, then reports `CD_IRQ_BUDGET exhausted=1` at `8005BBB0` after 9,280,239
instructions. Run 13 stopped at `800423B0` in the same phase; that PC alone did
not prove an unmapped instruction. The explicit budget diagnostic identifies
the remaining IRQ-work allowance, not the per-call PAC decoder limit. Extending
renewal to image uploads requires a validated bounded progress condition; this
checkpoint does not silently raise the general limit.

Latest focused validation: **626 passed** (source exports, overlay selection,
native publication, PAC progress guard, CD owner and log parser). The real-disc
LIST fixture plus insufficient-decoder-budget and infinite-copy controls also
pass **3 tests** in `progress-irq-checks.log`. No full-suite pass is claimed.
Continuation runs 15–16 address the remaining productive IRQ work. The
image allowance renews only after a completed mode-1 callback advances the
64-byte bitmap's one-hot cursor (at most 512 tiles) and consumes a consecutive
sector. Run 15 reaches LBA 6542 in SPU-data mode4, proving image progress beyond
the prior stop. Modes2/3/4 now renew only after completed LIST callbacks show
consecutive expected-sector advancement from the real DMA header comparison.
Stationary/backward/skipped/overflowing identities do not renew. Run16 and the
real-disc LIST/header-corruption/infinite-decode controls are the current checks.


The captured display still reads **NOW LOADING…**. **Menu/logo: NOT_PROVEN.**
The inherited diagnostic runner supplies held R1 and an automatic Start press
during overlay 0007, loads member 0007 through a host helper, and makes its
window nonfocusable. These are unresolved native-launch/input limitations,
not human menu acceptance or full retail boot parity. No commit or push was
made during takeover.

## Current continuation milestone — 2026-09-06

The latest retained native run completes projection, ClearImage, both framebuffer
environments, and the second InitGeom call. It stops at camera setup **800144D4**
(NPC800144D8, RA80014478, SP801FFF90). **Menu: NOT_REACHED; scanout disabled.**

Since the previous CPU/GTE checkpoint, 831 additional retail words were exported
and independently compared against the pinned EXE and assembly. These include
projection and its queue calls, ClearImage, framebuffer constructors, and the
second geometry caller. Existing matched C bodies remain under conditional
exports; no new C match or registry change is claimed. Signed DIV at52868 uses
proven MIPS results and retains the source zero-divisor BREAK refusal.

The actual source ClearImage builds a five-command DMA packet containing GP0(02)
for black RECT(0,0,640,480). The GPU owner consumes the complete three-word fill
before publishing one canonical PsyCross VRAM update. Real readback checks all
307200 pixels with zero mismatches. Controller/backend each record one completed
fill; the final run completes eight DMA transfers and47 payload words without
fault. Partial fills preserve their packet state across DMA boundaries; DMA
readiness uses data readiness, allowing the remaining words while command-ready
is low. FIFO reset, backend refusal and drawing-state independence are covered.

The backend uses the existing PsyCross canonical VRAM copy/read functions. Its
old clear helper mispacks nonblack colors, so the adapter derives PSX RGB555
explicitly and handles wrapping. No vendor renderer code or Xenogears checkout
was changed. Nonblack-to-black content checks belong to the graphics fixture;
the native source itself supplied black, with no host prepaint.

The retail framebuffer constructors complete naturally. AtAF668/AF6C4 the draw
rectangles are(0,10,320,220)/(0,250,320,220), with offsets(160,120)/(160,360).
Texture-window halfwords+10/+12 are256; tpage+14 remains000A. The display
rectangles atAF77C/AF790 are(0,0,320,240)/(0,240,320,240). Whole-RAM fixtures cover
padding, nested stack stores, register preservation, NTSC/PAL and height480.

The second InitGeom enters through14444 and reuses the same CPU Status, BIOS
image, kernel/card hook and GTE bank. Actual publication reaches generation3
and28 patch stores; the GTE owner records20 control transfers. Source Status is
40000401, all logged owners are healthy and all owned teardown succeeds.
The new14454 ancestry is admitted only at the two existing CP0 and seven
InitGeom CTC2 sites; screen-distance4923C accepts its actual14468 caller.
Optional ClearImage diagnostic aliases59844/5986C refuse before clock or effects.

Retained evidence is under `artifacts/spu-startup-20260906/native/`, including
`gpu-fill-integration-1`, `draw-env-integration-1` and `second-geom-integration-1`.
Earlier refused-packet and projection captures remain immutable. The latest
binary SHA256 is40bfde77c707be53a9038ae5b2492713a7dfbbeddc365a38ee621ca1480e2ab5;
log SHA256 is79f05997303a3a9d76bfda25345ea93519d5191f194fcd250cba8840e04e7b03.

Validation: 57 focused GPU/fill/ClearImage/export tests pass; all 22 graphics tests,
11 headless tests and the symbol check pass. The extended persistent second-InitGeom
fixture passes all six cases, including four compiled mutants and ASan/UBSan.
The full Python suite passes 1029 tests and 92 subtests in 786.53 seconds.
All 177 test-file pins and 82 production-file pins remained unchanged during
that run. Aggregate evidence is `artifacts/spu-startup-20260906/gpu-fill-verification.json`.
The earlier CPU/GTE full-run failure remains recorded in its historical
manifest; a focused replacement pass did not retroactively make that run green.

Next is the actual camera initializer144D4 and its source descendants. The
source audit in `second-geom-source-plan.md` identifies a future LZCS/LZCR data
transfer at47D3C; that is not yet executed or supported. The 11-function camera
stage contains 572 independently checked words, outside production.
`gte-data-transfer-plan.md` specifies the signed leading-bit correction and
one-instruction MFC2 load delay needed before admitting those operations. Native timing remains
a reference policy, not hardware parity. Enabled scanout, retail title/menu
assets and primitives, usable launcher and human menu acceptance remain open.

Mounted native startup now completes the full sound initializer and returns
naturally to `800101FC`, then enters file loading at `8001971C`. All fourteen
remaining sound/TOC streams (575 words) are mapped and byte-checked against the
pinned EXE. Actual GetTN/GetTD commands read all four mounted disc tracks; source
code writes the complete track table and restores its caller stack. Xenogears'
MIT PsyCross ADSR helper supplies configurable envelopes in the shared SPU owner.
Actual mode4 reverb feedback RAM writes are observed at the final sound return.

The sound checkpoint passes707 pytest tests plus84 subtests,21 graphics and10
headless CTests. Its final trace checker passes108 focused tests, including
malformed logs, packet/order/deadline mutations and missing real reverb work.
See `artifacts/spu-startup-20260906/outer-verification.json`. The retained binary
below belongs to that checkpoint; the working build continues beyond it.

```sh
python3 tools/native_spu_boot_check.py --sound-outer \
    artifacts/spu-startup-20260906/native/sound-outer-native-boot \
    extracted/disc/files/SLUS_007.26 extracted/disc/disc.cue extracted/disc/disc.bin
```

The retained sound checkpoint is historical. A later historical draw checkpoint
stopped at BIOS/GTE initialization `80053CF8` after DMA2 and display setup. Progressive VSync remains conditional on actual source/GPU
state, while the interlaced `XOR` path is unsupported. Hardware timing/DSP
rounding, audible game sound and the menu remain unproven.

**Menu: NOT_REACHED.** The four-input check below opens the pinned disc and real
SDL audio owner; the one-EXE diagnostic intentionally retains its unmounted
`80044DBC` boundary.

In the preceding CD phase, the game issues `01`, `0A`, `0C`, drains four source
CD interrupts, and publishes
main gains `7FFE`, CD gains `3FFF`, and control `C001`. CD, SPU, Timer1, Timer2,
SIO and real VBlank events share the existing device epoch; reads do not create
time. Full digital input callbacks now return through their source, with
256-byte BIOS scratch `[84D8,85D8)`, eight return records and a counted
16384-instruction limit. The cold fixture covers three rejected `43` attempts
and recovery; native polling is timing-dependent and is not that fixture trace.

Validation: 633 pytest tests plus 84 subtests, 21 graphics CTests, 10 headless
CTests and symbol checks pass. The final SPU checker additionally passes 32
focused tests after its hardening; the historical CD checkpoint retains its own
580-test evidence. Four new
compiled digital-IRQ mutants and a live SDL no-queue mutant are rejected.
Real PipeWire queue/drain proves output progress; audible game sound, complete
BIOS/hardware cycle parity, the menu and launcher acceptance remain unproven.
The shared SPU now performs two actual 16-byte uploads, clocks all 24 voices,
registers DMA callback `3AA18` once, and opens/enables one polling event. Final
main gains are `7FFE`, CD gains are zero, and control is `C000`; sound RAM at
`1000..100F` contains the source-uploaded `07` bytes. The bounded synthesis subset
supports filter 0 and active ADSR `0000/0000`, with explicit refusals outside it.
Manual writes commit actual RAM synchronously under the documented native
policy; physical FIFO/key subphase and measured Gaussian rounding remain unproven.
The next common-attribute call also returns naturally at `8002C974`: seven actual
register writes restore CD gains `3FFF` and control `C001`, retaining the event
and uploaded RAM. Its live checker and 47 focused tests pass; evidence is sealed
in `artifacts/spu-startup-20260906/common-verification.json`. Reverb processing
and CD track-table commands remain ahead in the outer sound initializer.

Historical common-attribute checkpoint command (requires its earlier binary):
```sh
python3 tools/native_spu_boot_check.py --common-attributes \
    build/menu-resume/musashi_native_boot extracted/disc/files/SLUS_007.26 \
    extracted/disc/disc.cue extracted/disc/disc.bin
```

See `artifacts/cd-native-owner-20260906/` for source authority, logs and reviews.

The fresh mounted checker and its 18 focused tests also pass; the CD checkpoint
is sealed in `artifacts/cd-native-owner-20260906/verification.json`. Work on the
next SPU phase is in progress and must not be read as a new native return claim.
The normal cold interpreter capture in `artifacts/spu-startup-20260906/retail-run2/`
returned through both initial SPU calls to `8002C90C`: 727 writes, 82 resolved
reads, 62578 preserved prelude writes, and one polling event registration.
The observer changed no guest state. Its private profile and CPU trace establish
the boot configuration; the retry screenshot was black, so GUI labels were not
visually verified. Hardware transfer/key timing and reference binary/source
build equivalence remain unproven. The native implementation uses explicit
source-backed device policies with real sound RAM and voice evolution.


The preserved `integration/mounted-ready-query.log` records source ledger
`1705913`, epoch `10524729`, 12 actual source edges, 16 IRQ deliveries and seven
keyboard samples. It contains two complete `42` packets and one `43` command;
other transactions time out naturally. These are observations, not quotas or
retail phase equivalence. The CD IRQ uses a 411-word exact source export and live
HookEntryInt-derived game scratch `[8006CA94,8006CAEC)`, independently of the
BIOS input frame and suspended startup CPU. The source four-word `426D4` read
and actual GPUSTAT/Timer1 word reads close the final CD polling dependencies.

The media owner verifies the exact CUE/BIN sizes and SHA-256 before exposing
an immutable private snapshot. The separately owned controller maintains the
response FIFO, internal IF/enable and deadlines; only the CPU IRQ owner latches
mask `0004`. Reset's second phase is scheduled from its source event deadline.
The SPU owner starts from an explicit settled BIOS-main-mute policy and renders
through its owned 44100 Hz stereo SDL sink. It does not implement the full voice,
transfer, ADSR or reverb behavior needed by the next game initialization.

```sh
python3 tools/native_cd_boot_check.py build/menu-resume/musashi_native_boot \
    extracted/disc/files/SLUS_007.26 extracted/disc/disc.cue extracted/disc/disc.bin
```

The checker uses private X11 and the actual user PipeWire runtime. A missing
real audio device is NOT_RUN. This command checks the bounded CD return and
`8002C8F4` stop; it does not certify a menu. Next-source plans are
`artifacts/cd-native-owner-20260906/integration/post-cd-spu-plan.md` and
`artifacts/spu-startup-20260906/capture-plan.md`.

All snapshots below are historical. The current checkpoint above supersedes
their smaller scratch sizes, partial input packets and unmounted CD boundary.

## Prior continuation snapshot

The native entry now executes CRT, constructor, graphics, InitCARD, StartCARD,
backup-unit initialization, eight BIOS event registrations, and input setup on
one source CPU. Input C0:03/C0:02/C0:0A services and the two IRQ-register writes
match the pinned retail observation. The game input descriptor precedes the
actual BIOS SIO owner; its source verifier and handler use a separate bounded
BIOS scratch stack. Unknown child calls retain their effects and refuse.

Input setup returns naturally at `800101E4`. CD initialization then prints
`CD_init:addr=8006cf68`, installs its callback, and stops at the first unbound
CD byte write, `80044DBC -> 1F801800` (bounded status `0`, executable exit `2`).
I_MASK and game enabled bits are `000D`, guest IRQ is enabled, and the input
owner/frame are healthy. The observed five VBlank deliveries preceded input
registration: no natural input IRQ ran in this short native or retail window.
The menu remains **NOT_REACHED**. Full CPU, cycle, low-RAM, hardware, and BIOS
cold-boot parity remain unproven; the executable loads the pinned EXE via host
`fread` and never executes retail-file code bytes.

## Historical advancement

The event milestone added exact 121/66-word registration/helper execution and
eight five-word flag callbacks. The current input milestone adds exact 26/91-word
verifier/handler exports, checked kernel ownership and C0 guest results, and a
112-byte native BIOS scratch frame `[8568,85D8)`. It does not copy a
BIOS RAM snapshot or borrow the interrupted game stack. The matched console
string body is composed into the same CPU's subsequent CD initialization.
No match-registry promotion, commit, or push was performed.

The serial continuation adds eight exact source exports (434 words), with four
mapped into the native formatter. The current native SIO owner now binds the
digital port-1 profile to the paced Timer2/device epoch and an SDL keyboard
provider, but the startup trace has `keyboard_polls=0`; no keyboard sample or
DATA-pad packet was observed. Six metadata edges are mapped, with four new
metadata arrays integrated; remaining exports stay source-only. The legacy
16-bit path still refuses the call to `F830` at `8005DB04`. The newer batch
contains 26 exact exports (1,528 words); only its two metadata bodies
`FB70` and `E228` are newly mapped, alongside the earlier `F830` and `F384` exports. Native boot and the updated live input fixture select NTSC through
`SetVideoMode` before PsyCross creates its worker; its unset default had chosen
PAL cadence. This establishes the native source policy, not retail video-phase
parity. The owner, source-clock, Timer2, source-word and live tests are recorded
in `artifacts/clock-epoch-20260905/integration-contract.md`; four clock
mutations reject lost edges, early waits, lost sticky faults and sequence gaps.

Fresh native observations before shutdown:

| State | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Native stop | status `0`, `pc=80044DBC`, target `80044DBC` (first unbound CD byte write) |
| Callback guard / enabled bits | `0001` / `000D` |
| IRQ slots 0 / 3 | `80042CE8` / `80042E08` |
| I_STAT / I_MASK | `0000` / `000D` |
| DPCR / DICR | `33333B33` / `00000000` |
| DMA2_CHCR | `00000401` |
| Timer 1 stored mode | `0507` |
| Custom VBlank policy selected | yes, by both game BIOS calls |
| BIOS CD installed / allocated events | `0` / `8` at stop |
| Guest IRQ enabled / faulted | `1` / `0` |
| Card state | initialized `1`, started `1`, active `0`, pad started `0` |
| Card hook / maintenance | calls `14` / `5` |
| Card SIO | mode `000D`, baud `0088`, control `0000`, delay calls `3` |
| SIO owner | digital port 1, cards absent, bound `1`, transmitted bytes `2`, keyboard polls `0` |
| Backup-unit state | flags `1111`, action `0`, last port `1`, step `0` |
| Memory-card policy | explicitly disconnected; two `81/FF` no-ACK transactions/timeouts |
| BU directories / status | `960` zero, `40` broken `FF`, status `5` zero |
| CARD lease / cleanup | priority-1 CARD lease gone; card+BU cleanup `1 / 1` |
| Card VBlank / game delivery | `5` edges / `5` IRQ deliveries and ticks |
| Active event records | 8 handles `f1000000..f1000007`, flags zero |
| Input descriptor / next | `80078988` / `000074A8` |
| Input owner/frame faults | `0 / 0` |
| Scheduler removed | `1` |
| First eight GPU writes | exact ordered match to retail |
| Native GPU query state | `GPUREAD=00000400`, query-7 leaves `GPUREAD=400` |
| Historical A0:72 cold-prefix deliveries / tick | **0 / 0**, before this continuation |

SYS(2) enables guest IRQ eligibility after cleanup. The scheduler's PsyCross
worker only queues VBlank edges. The owner pump runs
at live FormatterCpu instruction/call checkpoints, coalesces pending edges,
and invokes the recovered dispatcher with its consumed B0:17 continuation.
Guest RAM worker writes and a broad host interrupt mutex are not used. This
run proves cleanup and the bounded handoff state, **not a delivered IRQ in the
cold prefix**; a separate live fixture proves the scheduler source path.

## Historical device contracts and limits

`pc_port/dma_controller.c` implements the two control registers and DICR's
write-one-to-clear flags and rising-edge IRQ3 assertion. Idle DMA channel-two
`CHCR=00000401` is supported as observed state; actual channel transfers and
other channel-register behavior remain rejected. Enabling DPCR does not
manufacture a transfer.
Contract: [PSX-SPX DMA Channels](https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/dmachannels/).

`pc_port/scanline_timer.c` implements only the observed timer 1 mode: wait for
the first VBlank, then count supplied HBlank edges, with interrupts disabled.
Mode writes reset the count; mode reads clear reached flags. Other modes are
rejected. Its edge tests are synthetic; a production HBlank source is still
missing, and the native owner does not expose this unscheduled counter to
guest reads. Contract: [PSX-SPX Timers](https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/timers/).

`pc_port/irq_policy.c` stores B0:5B/C0:0A acknowledgement choices. Native policy
starts unknown, not as an asserted retail BIOS state. The event provider
refuses custom delivery until both competing VBlank acknowledgements have
explicitly been disabled. This does not implement BIOS pad/timer IRQ handlers.
Contract: [PSX-SPX Kernel](https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/kernelbios/).

`pc_port/bios_events.c` and `pc_port/bios_kernel.c` own the native BIOS event
records and priority registry. The CD session opens five class
`F0000003` polling events, registers IO then DMA nodes, enables them, and A0:72
closes the five owned handles and unlinks the two owned nodes while preserving
game RAM and unrelated registrations. The CD executor is intentionally
unavailable and refuses if actual handler execution is requested; this is a
native service boundary, not whole-BIOS emulation.

## Reproduce earlier boundaries

```sh
cmake -S . -B build/menu-resume \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew \
  -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew
cmake --build build/menu-resume -j 8
python3 tools/native_boot_check.py build/menu-resume/musashi_native_boot \
  extracted/disc/files/SLUS_007.26
```

The check rejects a malformed EXE before display initialization, then runs the
pinned image under Xvfb and requires executable exit 2 with bounded status 0 plus the complete state above,
including `pc=80044dbc`, `target=80044dbc`, `bios_cd_installed=0`,
`bios_event_used=8`, `guest_irq_enabled=1`, `irq_faulted=0`, and the BU/card
cleanup flags.
CTest names this `native_startup_boundary`. Passing certifies the documented
refusal, not a bootable game. The executable can also run directly on desktop.

The earlier 457 Python tests and 16 CTest targets are historical verification
for the previous A0:72 boundary. The latest validation is **557 passed plus 84 subtests** and **21/21 CTest
tests**, with graphics/headless builds, archive symbol verification, focused
NTSC/live checks, and diff checks passing. The Timer2 owner is integrated under
a paced host-time device epoch with variable phase; the native final check still
stops at the CD byte boundary. Six additional Timer2 focused tests pass,
including the large-`UINT64_MAX` case.
Source exports include **121/66**
word-exact event-registration/helper exports and eight five-word callback exports; prior **40/28/37**
compiled matches remain historical. These checks certify
bounded startup progress, not a bootable game.

The controller integration contract is pinned in
`artifacts/controller-protocol-20260905/integration-contract.md`. Its retail
contract is digital port 1 (`01`, `42`, responses `41 5A buttons_lo buttons_hi`)
with separate absent-card `81` ownership. The selected-device correction and
focused identity probe pass, but the native run has not sampled a keyboard or
completed a DATA exchange. A synthetic fixture reaches the `DC04`/`EAE8`
refusal and records metadata stores; that is not natural controller or menu
evidence. The final controller suite passes 557 Python tests plus 84 subtests and all
21 CTest checks. Seven compiled callback/SIO mutations are rejected; the
earlier failed fixture run is preserved separately.

Validation is scoped to owned state. The fresh native session matches the five
owned CD records (140 bytes) and all 22 event status words before and after
cleanup. It does not match the full 616-byte initial event table: retail unused
slots retain prior BIOS payloads and stale stack words, which are deliberately
not seeded into the native runtime. `allocation_serial` metadata and leases
detect replacement of a CD-owned slot without changing guest handles or the
B0 low-16-bit alias. `tests/test_bios_events.py` still compares the full 616
bytes for cleanup from an identical captured input; `tests/test_bios_kernel.py`
checks the native owned-record/status result and the negative full-table
mismatch. The preserved `artifacts/bios-remove-20260905/kernel-full-table-mismatch.log`
is a failed validation attempt, not full BIOS initial-RAM parity.

The graphics continuation is recorded in
`artifacts/gpu-startup-20260905/retail-run1/manifest.json`, with native output
in `artifacts/gpu-startup-20260905/native-first.log`. The authoritative
GPU-state range `80072740..80074750` matches retail after at 8208 bytes;
CPU stack/kernel and unrelated coldboot state are excluded. Physical GPU
revision response is unproven. Blank-only presentation is available; geometry,
VRAM transfer, and enabled scanout remain unsupported. The separately tracked
reset-owned clears `80078874..80078974` (256 bytes) and
`800C5510..800C6D10` (6144 bytes), plus queue scalars `8007288C/90/9C`, also
match the native capture; the broad 8208-byte range is not the entire GPU
working-set authority.

The entry continuation CPU comparison is recorded in
`artifacts/entry-continuation-20260905/cpu-comparison.json`; it compares raw
32-register arrays at five interim boundaries. The new comparison reports
13/15/14 GPR differences at ENTRY/RETURN/NEXT; the selected frame agrees
except RETURN `a0` (native `1`, retail `2`, following the SYS2 source value).
Full CPU parity is unestablished. The native initial GPR/HI/LO profile and
incoming RA are zeroed, rather than retail-seeded. Differences outside the
selected call/frame comparison have no automatic ABI-clobber causality.

The preceding event check reached InitCARD, StartCARD, `_bu_init`, and the eight event
Open/Enable/Test operations, then stops at `8005D8D8 -> 8005E178`. The eight
active callback records and zero flags match retail's first five words; the
registration return `v0=1` is a source comparison literal for a void path, not
successful API proof. BU state remains matched, with two disconnected-card transactions completed
by VBlank timeouts and five deliveries/ticks in the observed run. The CPU comparison has 15/12 GPR
differences at ENTRY/RETURN and HI/LO differences; selected
`v0/gp/sp/fp/ra` match. Full CPU, cycle, low-RAM, menu, or hardware parity
remains unproven.
The preceding event log and raw retail comparison are
`artifacts/backup-events-20260905/native-check.log` and
`artifacts/backup-events-20260905/comparison.json`. All 24 operation arguments
and results, eight handles/flags, and five words of all eight active records
match; unused event records are excluded. The synthetic CPU probe also covers
24 refusal positions and a full pool. Three compiled negative mutations fail
those checks. These fixtures are separate from runtime observation.

The latest input evidence is `artifacts/input-kernel-20260905/native-check.log`
and `comparison.json`. All 14 logged input RAM words, three service arguments
and results, and both MMIO writes match raw retail evidence at `800101E4`.
The input CPU comparison reports 9/13 GPR differences at ENTRY/RETURN and
HI/LO differences; selected `v0/gp/sp/fp/ra` agree. Downstream CD execution is
outside that retail capture. Dedicated-frame tests verify masked/disabled
branches, normal guest-zero returns, partial child-call refusal, scratch guards,
reentry refusal and retained faults. Three compiled input-frame mutations are
rejected. The separate `input_irq_live` fixture uses real PsyCross edges: a disabled
input handler returns guest zero, then BIOS SIO/custom dispatch advances tick1;
the next enabled handler retains its writes. The integrated optional serial path
now reaches the exact SIO writes and the paced Timer2 owner, driven by checked
source advance and actual host-time device cuts, before the legacy 16-bit-only call refusal at `8005DB04 -> F830`.
With byte providers, metadata execution now reaches `8005DC04 -> 8005EAE8`;
`read16` does not advance Timer2. The source ledger reaches `950315`; the paced
host device epoch advances from actual host-time cuts with variable phase.
The earlier source-only Timer2 count `8039` is historical; current counts vary
with elapsed host time. This does not establish retail phase parity, a natural controller transaction or a
completed input IRQ. `8005FBC8` remains mapped only for isolated tests, and
`8005DBD8` first refuses at its state-table indirect call (`8005DC04`). The
source ledger accounts for startup/input instructions while the paced device
epoch advances Timer2 and the bound native SIO device from host-time cuts; CD and video deadlines remain
disconnected. The current CD controller remains an unbound,
synthetic-tested model with caller-supplied drive status/cycles.

## Earlier next-work snapshot

1. Implement the CD byte-register/device path at `80044DBC`, preserving command,
   interrupt and data semantics; the source-authoritative three-boot contract is
   `artifacts/cd-init-device-20260905/contract.md`.
2. Exercise the bound digital SIO owner through a natural keyboard/DATA-pad
   transaction, then continue the remaining CD command/data path. The current
   synthetic metadata fixture is not a natural controller transaction.
3. Supply production HBlank/GPU and SPU timing/ownership, then continue CD
   loading, menu overlays, and interactive presentation. None is menu,
   hardware, whole-BIOS, or whole-CPU parity proof.

### Retail A0:72 trace correction and bounded findings

This is a diagnostic metadata correction. The verified retail call sites are
`jal 800427CC -> 8005CE50` (A0:72, with `ra=800427D4`),
`jal 800427BC -> 80042DB8` (channel installer), and
`jal 800427D4 -> 8005CF18` (SYS(2), ExitCriticalSection). Earlier call-site
labels in continuation notes and ignored logs remain historical evidence; the
source-owned instruction streams were already retail-exact and are unchanged.

The read-only interpreter trace in
`artifacts/bios-remove-20260905/retail-run3/observer.log` (parent exit 0),
driven by [`tools/retail_bios_remove_observe.lua`](../tools/retail_bios_remove_observe.lua),
shows the selected BIOS path closing events `f1000000` through `f1000004` and
removing the priority-zero nodes `a00091d0` and `a00091e0`. Its live C0:03
target is `00001444`, read from slot `80000680`; this path avoids the
stack-load branches at `000014A4` and `000014B8`. SR is `40000000` before and
after A0:72, then `40000401` after SYS(2). The trace changed 63 RAM bytes and
performed zero MMIO writes. The next GPU command is `00072740`, with
`ra=800592DC` at the correctly identified call `800592D4 -> 8005CE38`.
These observations qualify this BIOS/path only; they do not establish generic
dequeue correctness or native BIOS parity.

Reproduce with the observer's required environment variable and a fresh
private PCSX-Redux profile:

```sh
MUSASHI_BIOS_OBSERVE_DIR=artifacts/bios-remove-20260905/retail-run3 \
  /home/blizz/Applications/pcsx-redux-src/AppDir/AppRun \
  --portable "$(mktemp -d)" --cli --testmode --interpreter --debugger \
  --bios /var/home/blizz/Projects/xenogears-decomp-ai/disc/scph5500.bin \
  --iso /var/home/blizz/Projects/brave-fencer-musashi-decomp/extracted/disc/disc.cue \
  --dofile /var/home/blizz/Projects/brave-fencer-musashi-decomp/tools/retail_bios_remove_observe.lua \
  --run
```

The runner still uses bounded diagnostic CPU frames and explicit native-zero
incoming RA. It is not whole-CPU cold boot or BIOS parity. Do not replay an
initializer after partial failure without reloading entry state.

Pre-edit hashes, source snapshots, and run logs are local-only under
`artifacts/menu-resume-20260905/`. No commit or push was made.

## Start-screen continuation export — 2026-09-08

The observed MAIN4 idle dispatch at 800CF300 now has a guarded native export
through its return delay slot at 800CF36C. Its 28 words are checked against
MAIN.CD member4. The function calls 800CF3E8, subtracts four from 800EC68C,
and, once negative, clears a 640x480 rectangle through 80059888 and advances
state through 800118AC. This is an instruction export, not a C MATCH claim.

800118AC now has a compiled implementation matching all 124 retail bytes with
GCC 2.7.2 / ASPSX 2.56, -O0 -G0. A global GCC register binding retains the
retail base-address evaluation without adding a local stack slot. The registry
conservatively classifies this as `mixed`; no emitted assembly instructions or
retail-word macros are used in its implementation branch. The installed source
was rebuilt and passed the matching oracle. Evidence candidate:
`artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/800118ac.bin`.

The fresh native build initially failed because 43 existing required export
inputs were absent and three implementation files lacked their native export
branches. These inputs were restored from `asm/main.s`, with every restored
word compared against the extracted EXE. Existing C bodies were preserved.
No new C recovery credit is claimed for those restored exports. The complete
`build/menu-takeover` build then succeeded; focused source/identity/progress
checks passed 673 tests and four subtests.

Fresh natural execution used no automatic Start, no held R1, and no preview
pause. Display/audio setup failures were resolved using Xvfb and the user's
PulseAudio runtime. The actual guest run completed 338 MDEC transfers, then
refused at 80046968, before proving the new CF300 continuation. The source at
80046964 clears CD data request (1F801803=0) while chopped DMA3 is still busy;
the next advance reports DMA3 fault1. The diagnostic shows CHCR01400100,
BCR00000066, FIFO requested0/cursor0, and due597493005 versus cycle597492991.
Investigate source DMA cancellation/request gating before changing this device
behavior. Do not bypass the write, force a menu state, or call CF300 runtime
verified. Full runtime log: `artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/runtime-stdout.log`.
The start-screen continuation goal remains active. No commit or push.

The broad `python3 -m pytest tests -q` run remains in progress (PID2545038,
unified exec session77193, log `/tmp/musashi-cf300-tests.log`). Its progress
already includes a failure; inspect the completed traceback before claiming
suite success. Re-poll this handle or verify the PID before restarting tests.
`git diff --check` also reports an unrelated existing blank line at EOF in
`src/overlays/main_0012/80128228.c`; this continuation did not edit that file.

### DREQ pause repair and post-fade continuation

The CD device now exposes checked request state separately from FIFO byte
availability. An in-flight chopped DMA3 pauses on deasserted BFRD/DREQ, retains
its remaining MADR/BCR and actual copied bytes, and raises no completion IRQ.
Reassertion resumes at the newly observed native cycle without spending the
paused interval as transfer credit. Invalid callback results and timestamp
overflow still refuse. A waiting transfer no longer blocks CD command progress
in the native scheduler. Atomic transfer behavior is unchanged.

Reference comparison: DuckStation `CDROM::UpdateStatusRegister` drives
`DMA::SetRequest` from BFRD; `DMA::CanTransferChannel` gates on request. This
supports explicit request gating, not a claim of physical chopping/bus timing.
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stenzek/duckstation/master/src/core/cdrom.cpp
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stenzek/duckstation/master/src/core/dma.cpp

The regression failed before the repair. Synthetic pause/resume, invalid
request, overflow, actual disc-backed FIFO rewind/resume, and native scheduler
checks pass. No fabricated bytes or completion flags are used.

Natural unpaused execution now passes 800CF300 and refuses at 800CF370:
`artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/dreq/runtime.log`. After exporting
800CF370 through its complete return delay slot, a second natural run passes
that routine and refuses at **800CF3A4**:
`artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/cf370/runtime.log`. DMA3 is
fault-free in both final snapshots. No Start/R1 was injected and no guest PC
or menu state was edited. These Xvfb runs establish continuation execution,
not a fresh human desktop acceptance or gameplay/attract completion.

The actual CF300 callee 80059888 (`ClearImage`) is now ordinary C, registered
as a complete 148-byte function. Unsigned-byte RGB arguments reproduce retail
scheduling. The installed source independently matches 37/37 words with
GCC2.7.2/ASPSX2.56 -O2 -G0; candidate is
`artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/80059888.bin`. Its neighboring
function starts at 8005991C; the old assembly label coalesces it, but the new
registry extent ends at the inspected first return delay slot. Parallel C
recovery continues on actual CF370 callee 800146B0; it is currently only an
instruction export, not a registered C match.

Latest build succeeds; 598 focused export/device/scheduler tests pass.
Both new natural runs finish 361 MDEC transfers before the later overlay boundary.
The earlier broad test run was deliberately interrupted after source changes
and confirmed fixture failures (6 failed, 229 passed, 72 subtests). It is no
longer live. Failures included stale SDL include metadata, missing callback
source linkage in fixtures, and one generated-include race during a source edit.
The audio test now passes using the current CMake SDL SDK. CD fixtures now
link their real required callback implementations with the proper native
compile definitions. The corrected integration run is live as PID2662002,
unified exec session42499, log `/tmp/musashi-start-continuation-integration.log`.
Poll it before rerunning or editing formatter includes. Full-suite success is
not claimed. Next natural boundary remains 800CF3A4. No commit or push.

800146B0 has now been installed and independently rebuilt: MATCH49/49 words,
196 bytes, GCC2.7.2/ASPSX2.56 -O2 -G0 with its actual link address800146B0.
Its C uses two empty compiler barriers and a register-bound zero argument;
these constraints emit no instructions. The registry records the classifier's
actual recovery category. Candidate evidence is
`artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/800146b0.bin`. It loads the selected
display-mode record, configures dimensions, resets graphics and invokes the
source clear/setup helpers. Parallel recovery moves to800183E0, called by the
observed pending CF3A4 continuation. The integration handle above is still live;
formatter include changes remain pending its completion to avoid a test snapshot
race. No whole-engine or gameplay recovery claim.

800183E0 is also installed and independently rebuilt: MATCH28/28 words,
112 bytes at its actual link address800183E0, GCC2.7.2/ASPSX2.56 -O2 -G0.
Empty constraints preserve the original base-relative access shape without
emitting instructions. It reserves the first inactive slot among32 entries,
stores the supplied word and clears one state byte; it has no callees.
Candidate: `artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/800183e0.bin`.
The 17-word CF3A4 export is checked against MAIN4 and added to CMake; its
formatter selector is still pending the current integration run. Adding a
source export alone is not a runtime-continuation claim.

The corrected integration run has completed successfully: **15 passed** in
579.32s, including CD/PVD semantic mutants and ClearImage sanitizers. PID2662002
and session42499 are terminal; do not resume them. The CF3A4 formatter selector
is now wired with MAIN4 selection and source-RAM identity checks. Focused
archive/selector/export checks pass615 tests after that wiring. Its fresh native
run is still pending the rebuild; do not infer execution from these static checks.
80014774, called by146B0, is also installed and independently MATCH17/17 words
as ordinary C (640x480 black ClearImage wrapper). Candidate is
`artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/80014774.bin`. The other called
setup helper147B8 remains an unregistered staging candidate, currently91/92.

### Natural CF3A4 completion and executable transition

The CF3A4 build ran naturally to the next executable dispatcher at **80011380**.
Evidence: `artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/cf3a4/runtime.log`.
The final snapshot has382 MDEC transfers and fault-free CD/DMA state, with
DMA3transfers1840 and1619592 actual bytes. The invocation at11380 is missing
from the previous formatter; it is not a device refusal.

800147B8 is now installed and independently MATCH92/92 (368 bytes), same pinned
toolchain at link address800147B8. Two empty output constraints eliminate the
last scheduling mismatch without emitted instructions. Registry classification
is `mixed`; evidence candidate is
`artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/800147b8.bin`.

The new11380 export includes the actual shared epilogue11664–1167C, even though
the disassembler labels that tail separately. All192 words in[11380,11680)
match the EXE and assembly; internal jumps remain within the complete range.
597 focused source tests pass. Its selector is wired and a fresh rebuild/run
is pending. Parallel C recovery is restricted to this actually selected routine.
No completion or runtime claim for11380 yet. No commit or push.

### Initialization helpers after 80011380

The `exe11380/runtime.log` run reached 800295D4 naturally (RA80011400).
Added checked native exports around the existing C for800295D4 and80029664;
independent pinned-toolchain rebuilds retain MATCH36/36 and11/11 respectively.
The resulting build completed. Its natural run, with automatic Start and R1
both disabled, is terminal (exit2):
`artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/init295d4/runtime.log`.
It passed those helpers and80011DCC, then refused at **80011E24** (RA80011518).
DMA3 reports1825 transfers,1613140 bytes,fault0. This is execution evidence
under Xvfb, not fresh human desktop acceptance.

The full80011380 C candidate remains unregistered in staging:191/192 words.
Its missing register copy cannot be counted as a match; a scratch experiment
that restores the copy enlarges the stack frame. Native export remains192 words.
Parallel C work moved to its directly called80011E24 initialization helper.
The24-word[80011E24,80011E84) native export now matches both EXE and assembly,
and its formatter selector is wired.600 focused word/overlay tests pass.
Rebuild is pending in `/tmp/musashi-11e24-build.log`; no claim yet for execution
through80011E24. Earlier corrected15-test integration pass remains valid at
its recorded source snapshot; no full-suite pass is claimed. No commit or push.

80011E24 C recovery is now installed and independently rebuilt with pinned
GCC2.7.2/ASPSX2.56 -O0 -G0 at its actual link address: **MATCH24/24**,96 bytes,
SHA256 `f66af3fcb8ac2684fc47416c46c6354a13ac4f274356fb97339d85565b4f3c8d`.
Registry classification is `c`; no inline assembly. The documented unused local
preserves the observed stack allocation. Candidate:
`artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/80011e24.bin`.
The build completed successfully;642 focused tests and4 subtests pass after
integration. Fresh run `init11e24/runtime.log` is pending (session91810).

The `init11e24` run is now terminal (exit2; session91810 closed). It executed
80011E24 and reached the next direct initialization callee **8005C4CC** with
A0=1,RA80011524. DMA3 reports1794 transfers,1556616 bytes,fault0. This is the
current observed refusal and next porting boundary; do not restart atCF300.
No live native runtime or test process is intentionally retained.80011380 C
remains unmatched191/192 and unregistered; its staging candidate is preserved.

### 8005C4CC initialization continuation

Added its4-word native export around the existing C body; all words agree with
EXE and assembly. Independent pinned-toolchain -O2 rebuild retainsMATCH4/4,
SHA256 `87bd1bfa5afbe8b47293da19db01aa2692dc70ef4001c9ee42db6d70346690e2`.
Candidate:`artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/8005c4cc.bin`.
601 focused source/overlay tests pass. Native rebuild is pending in
`/tmp/musashi-5c4cc-build.log` (session1650). C recovery continues independently
on the actually selected11380 state machine; its191/192 candidate is not a match.

The5C4CC build and natural `init5c4cc/runtime.log` run are terminal. Execution
passed initialization and reached **801282AC** (RA80128168). This is specifically
an overlay identity refusal: `expected=8c22eea0 loaded=8c224f08`, not a missing
instruction export or DMA failure. DMA3 reports3077 transfers,2670396 bytes,
fault0. The formatter's broad SC01-member0[80128158,80128420) selector supplies
the expected word; even the existing MAIN0012 word at this PC is8c22e618, so
switching blindly to that member would also be wrong. Identify the newly loaded
PAC/overlay before changing selection; retain the source-RAM identity guard.
No fresh human desktop acceptance is claimed.

80011380 is now independently rebuilt and registered: **MATCH192/192**, full
768-byte range including shared epilogue. Pinned GCC2.7.2/ASPSX2.56 -O0 -G0,
SHA256 `fb39f11f5727441e3db4c0d1419194edbf967417ebe2866d71b486bbd7753b5b`.
Candidate:`artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/80011380.bin`.
Removing hard register bindings from two live index locals preserved the missing
copy without growing the frame. One empty input constraint emits no instructions;
current registry classifier reports `c`. This supersedes prior191/192 status.
No commit/push. Runtime session44967 closed; no runtime intentionally left live.

### SC02 member31 identification

A bounded scan of decoded type4 PAC0 streams in SC archives found one candidate
for the observed801282AC word: **SC02.CD member31**. ArchiveSHA256
`8a04737374845155390268f7269c1599ecf6b6669357089059b20f1dcad11607`, member offset
15247360,size1050624, PAC length329157. The source-backed decoder consumes327109
bytes, emits588215 bytes, SHA256
`5bb5b6364206ccd0c47d6cf6a1dc2627e13bbef3cda40d618103b92ccfef4db6`.
The178-word entry span differs from SC01 at only80128218,8012821C,801282AC.

Added SC02's exact[80128158,80128420) export. At the natural80128158 entry,
selection requires all178 words to match guest RAM; each executed overlay word
still passes the existing identity guard. No RAM is replaced. Exhaustive tests
reject every single-word mutation and every unreadable word, and distinguish
SC01/SC02 selector outputs.666 focused tests and4 subtests pass. Updated the
shared test include resolver for this explicitly named PAC export. BIOS callback
integration is pending (`/tmp/musashi-sc02-bios-tests.log`,session67438).
Build session78255 completed; natural run `sc02entry/runtime.log` is pending.

80011B7C is independently rebuilt and registered as C: MATCH37/37,148 bytes,
pinned GCC2.7.2/ASPSX2.56-O0-G0 actual link address. SHA256
`e1fb6ee4d4a1b8cdc2fc08ce196f7e93fc5a648dcbeff2567d4e286632d0f391`.
Candidate:`artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/80011b7c.bin`.
It writes the supplied halfword and clears seven related halfwords; no callees.
No commit/push or human desktop acceptance claim.

BIOS callback integration completed:1 passed in44.60s; session67438 closed.

The natural SC02-entry run passed the full178-word guest-RAM match, executed
through the former801282AC identity refusal, and reached **80128420** via the
retail dispatch table (RA801282BC,V0=80128420). Evidence:
`artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/sc02entry/runtime.log`.
No overlay word mismatch is reported. DMA3:3028 transfers,2595600 bytes,fault0.
This establishes SC02 member31 for the executed entry span; it does not authorize
arbitrary later code without decoded-source validation. Next boundary is its
selected80128420 routine. No runtime/gameplay completion claim.

### SC02 initialization routine

Decoded80128420 is a38-word initialization routine ending801284B8. Its first
callee80129220 (10words) invokes80129258 (9words: clear128 halfwords at stride56)
and80129248 (4words: store the supplied halfword flag). Exported all four complete
spans from the same pinned SC02 member31 PAC0 decode. They require the previously
established SC02 entry identity, and retain per-instruction guest-RAM comparison.
625 source/selector tests pass, including all new export words and rejecting
these ranges when SC02 is not selected. Build pending:
`/tmp/musashi-sc02-init-build.log`,session22780. No execution claim yet for the
new ranges. Parallel C recovery is working on actually called main8002D4C8.

Build22780 completed.667 focused tests and4 subtests pass after source integration.
Natural run `sc02init/runtime.log` is pending (session29541); auto Start and R1

The C dispatches commands by range and processes pending work; no assembly.

Natural `sc02init` run is terminal (exit2,session29541 closed). It executed the
record-clear/flag chain and reached **801378F0**, RA80128438, the second direct
callee of80128420. DMA3:3024 transfers,2585232 bytes,fault0; no overlay word
mismatch. Current next boundary is801378F0 in the same verified SC02 member31.
No runtime/test process intentionally retained. No commit or push.

### SC02 record initialization at801378F0

Added complete58-word[801378F0,801379D8) and20-word[8013A860,8013A8B0)
exports from pinned member31. The first clears a0xBFC-byte block, initializes
three0x4C-byte records from four retail halfwords each, then invokes the second
to clear two16-byte records. Both call80016714, whose existing checked native
binding remains unchanged pending runtime evidence.620 source/selector tests pass.
Build pending:`/tmp/musashi-sc02-378f0-build.log`,session94528.

no new allowance or host-state patch was introduced for SC02.

Natural `sc02records` run is terminal (exit2,session9225 closed). It passed
801378F0,8013A860 and the subsequent80011E24 call, reaching **80128C14** with
RA80128448. DMA3 reports3020 transfers,2605024 bytes,fault0; no overlay identity
mismatch. This is the current SC02 initialization boundary. No runtime/test
process intentionally retained, no commit/push, no gameplay completion claim.

### SC02 parameter selection at80128C14

Added33-word[80128C14,80128C98) exact decoded export under the established SC02
identity selector. It chooses a parameter from the signed halfword at800B9A08
and calls existing matched80010AE0.620 source/selector tests pass. Build pending:

### SC02 clear at8013C98C

Exported full14-word[8013C98C,8013C9C4) from pinned member31. Clears8bytes via
80016714 and zeros two globals. Build34927 completed;668 focused tests and4

Comparison freshly decodes the hash-pinned SC02 archive, not main EXE. This C
remains **unregistered** because current main/overlay oracle coverage does not
include this decoded PAC region. No progress-credit or registry-support claim.
No commit/push.

Natural `sc02clear` run is terminal (exit2,session52796 closed). It passed

### SC02 block initialization at80129C40

Exported complete46-word[80129C40,80129CF8) from pinned member31. Clears eight
0xA4-byte blocks and three byte flags, then calls existing exported800144D4.
24 focused decoded-source/selector tests pass. Build pending:

2591224 bytes,fault0; no overlay mismatch. This next call is in the lower overlay
address space: verify its loaded-member authority before exporting a same-address
routine. No live runtime intentionally retained, no completion claim.

### MAIN10 reset at800D0630

The logged lower-overlay eight-word prefix uniquely matches MAIN.CD member10,
at member offset20004 (base20000=>800CEDF8). Fresh archive member extraction
agrees exactly with `extracted/overlays/main/0010.bin`. Added11-word
[D0630,D065C) wrapper and14-word[D065C,D0694) reset helper under MAIN10 selection.
Both new ranges additionally require each instruction to match live guest RAM.
26 decoded-source/selector tests pass. Build pending:

These remain unregistered: no MAIN10 registry target/symbol-map configuration.
Clarification for earlier SC02 notes: the generic oracle supports flat blobs;
the missing support is reproducible registry target/decoded-artifact and symbol
configuration, not an inability to compare decoded bytes. Natural run

Previous verified object boundary remains8001C9D0. No runtime intentionally live.

### DMA fault localization, behavior unchanged

The preserved CD IRQ frame stopped at retail80046EAC: store20943 to pointer
D8006D068, the recordedCDROM_DELAY register1F801018. Current DMA write32 rejects
all writes whileCHCR_BUSY before inspecting address. Added failure-only
`CD_WORD_REFUSED` diagnostic to native_boot, preserving rejection behavior.
Build39519 passed. A deterministic synthetic pause/resume probe reproduces this
exact valid delay-register rejection with active01400100 and faultACCESS;
source:`artifacts/start-screen-continuation-20260908/dma_refusal_diag/busy-delay-repro.c`.
It retains RAM/MADR/BCR/CHCR; it is not physical timing proof.

Source comparison inspected DuckStation Bus::HWHandlers::MemCtrlWrite:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stenzek/duckstation/master/src/core/bus.cpp
It updates delay registers separately, without DMA busy gating. DMA register
writes are separately implemented in core/dma.cpp. This supports reviewing our
blanket guard, not blindly permitting every write or claiming bus-cycle parity.

Fresh diagnostic run `dma_refusal_diag/runtime.log` is terminal (exit2,
session13932 closed). No CD_WORD_REFUSED occurred in this timing-sensitive run;
it reached **80053290**,A0=800D9290,RA8001C3D0, after object/matrix initialization.
DMA3:3042 transfers,2621400 bytes,fault0. This does NOT resolve the preserved
intermittent busy-delay fault. Correct/verify that guard before treating the
runtime path as stable. Parallel C work for53290 remains staging-only pending
worker result. No commit/push or completion claim.

DMA fixture suite completed:3 passed in1.30s. Worker53290 finished with reported
MATCH30/30 candidate at `/tmp/musashi-53290/candidate.bin` and
`staging/start-screen/80053290.c`; parent integration/independent oracle still
pending. Preserve staging; worker is terminal. Runtime and diagnostic tests closed.

### Busy CD memory-control delay correction

Added deterministic regression `chopped_delay_write`: paused/resumed chopped
DMA accepts retail80046EAC's20943 delay write without changing channel state,
deadline,RAM,FIFO progress or completion, then completes pending bytes normally.
It failed before the fix at that write. Negative controls retain refusal for
busy MADR/BCR/CHCR writes and invalid delay values. Changed only the busy guard:
CDROM_DELAY is an independent memory-control register and still uses existing
value validation. DMA channel writes remain guarded.4 DMA/publication tests pass
in1.34s; build91913 completed. Natural `dma_delay_fix/runtime.log` pending,

### Resource relocation native exports

Wrapped existing matched C80053290 (30words) and800553D8 (7words) with checked

### Complete native primitive packet builder553F4

Exported all595 retail words[800553F4,80055D40), checked against EXE andassembly.
Control-flow checks cover all direct branches/jumps and all30retail jump-table

Build/tests pending:`/tmp/musashi-553f4-build.log`,session88637.
Worker recovered full switch draft and identified zero-count dependence on
incomingt0 (first assigned inside loop5547C, read at55CE8). Preserve this retail
edge case; do not initialize it away or reduce primitive/count coverage.

Build88637 completed;606 source/control-flow/DMA checks pass in1.64s. Natural

retail; oracle LENGTH_MISMATCH. No integration or registration. It includes the
reconstructed30-way table and an attempted incomingt0 preservation constraint;
semantic review and exact matching remain, so this is not proof of C fidelity.
Preserve `/tmp/musashi-553f4/` including candidate.bin,with-table.s,raw.txt and

### SC02 initialization flag helpers

Exported the three actually called two-word byte-clear helpers47084,47098,470AC
(full ends4708C,470A0,470B4). They clear object+221,+220,+222 in branch delay

80059A80 C worker remains active; native execution is not a C-match claim.

### Correction:8005B750 is a GPU backend refusal

Read-only diagnosis supersedes the preceding unsupported-native-boundary
label.8005B750 is already in complete exported[8005B710,8005B75C); it
writes linked-list DMA2 CHCR=01000401. The preserved moveimage log states:
`gpu_dma2: GP0 refused node=000c659c word=000c65a0 value=80000000 opcode=80 fill_words=0 store_phase=0 accepted=0`.
GPU_DMA2 fault3 is MUSASHI_GPU_DMA2_BACKEND; accepted_in_transfer=0,
payload=4. Thus the next work is GP0 VRAM-to-VRAM copy command support,
not CPU instruction export. gpu_controller.c accepts fill/store/primitives/
environment commands but has no opcode80 parser. Existing backend already
exposes read_vram/store_vram; gpu_psycross implements both through real VRAM.

backend, horizontal overlap direction, vertical propagation and zero width.
Implementation worker /root/gpu_copy owns only gpu_controller.c/header;
parent owns tests/docs/runtime. Reference overlap ordering is emulator-derived,

### Matrix MULTU boundary diagnosis

The matrix run terminated with exit 2 at 80049D78, instruction 01690019
(`multu t3,t1`), inside the complete exported matrix routine. DMA3 reported
3115 transfers, 2638888 bytes, fault 0. The interpreter lacked SPECIAL
function 25; this was not a missing function export.

Added unsigned 32-by-32 multiplication into HI/LO. The regression probe
uses the actual retail instruction and 49 operand pairs, including unsigned
high-bit and negative-looking matrix operands, and checks clock refusal
preserves CPU state. Before implementation the new execution assertion failed
(48.60s). Existing signed MULT and BCD checks remain in the same probe.
This implements arithmetic semantics within the existing execution clock;
it does not establish hardware multiply latency parity.

Parallel pinned builds also verified the existing assembly implementations
8004914C (12 words), 800491AC (8 words), and 8004945C (12 words), under
/tmp/musashi-gte-camera/. These use GTE instructions and are not ordinary C
recovery. No commit or push.

MULTU verification: the full arithmetic probe passed (48.62s), and the native
build passed (/tmp/musashi-multu-build.log). Natural `multu/runtime.log`
terminated with exit 2; see the current boundary below.

Current natural boundary: **8012F14C**, RA=80181684, A0=801FFE28,
A1=801FFE48. The matrix routine returned through its retail caller. DMA3:
3051 transfers, 2593572 bytes, fault 0; no GP0 refusal or overlay mismatch
reported. The exact 22-word C transform wrapper remains staged for integration.
This is instruction-path progress, not human-visible start-screen acceptance.
Goal remains active; no commit/push.

### Transform wrapper and following lighting C

Integrated full SC02 8012F14C [8012F14C,8012F1A4), 22 words. Parent rebuilt
production source with pinned GCC/ASPSX and independently matched 22/22
against the pinned decoded SC02 member (function SHA above). Native export
requires SC02 selection and existing per-word RAM identity. SC02 export and
overlay identity checks: 26 passed. Native build passed. SC02 recovery remains
outside the supported registry targets; no main-registry credit assigned.

Parallel decomp traced return80181684 through the camera callbacks to world
initializer801450C0, followed by8002850C and80028620. Integrated ordinary C
for full80028620 [80028620,80028694),29 words, independently rebuilt and

It copies a16-byte light record, handles a zero vector, and calls80053328.
Registered as complete C; existing native words remain identical. All616
main native-export checks passed. This does not claim the future call has
executed in the current natural run. No commit/push.

Natural transform run terminated exit2 at **8004914C**, RA=8012F170,
A0=801FFE28, SP=801FFDF0. DMA3:3092 transfers,2612260 bytes,fault0.
The next work is the complete GTE rotation-load, translation-load, and vector
transform path called by the recovered wrapper. Read-only audit confirms
shared doCOP2 supports MVMVA4A480012; interpreter admission/transfer handling
is missing. Required sites include LWC2 data0/1, SWC2 data11 (distinct from
legacy control-read site), and delayed CFC2 FLAG31. Preserve exact caller/site
and callback guards. No human-visible acceptance or goal completion claimed.

### SC02 GTE transform path under verification

Added complete retail instruction exports for8004914C (12words),800491AC
(8words),8004945C (12words), retaining their existing assembly branches.
Parent pinned rebuilds matched12/12,8/8,12/12 againstEXE. These are GTE
assembly, not ordinary C. Main export checks619passed.

Added bounded SC02caller/PC/word admission for rotationCTC2, translationCTC2,
LWC2V0, MVMVA4A480012, MFC2IR1/2, SWC2IR3, and delayed CFC2FLAG31.
Owner controls5..7 and read-only31 added with positive and rejected-selector,
context,CU2,lease and reentry tests (4tests,2subtests passed).

First gtetransform natural run exited2 at80129398,RA801452DC; DMA3
3173transfers,2619644bytes,fault0. This run is SUPERSEDED for transform
acceptance: review found the owner raw IR read and initial fixture expected
stale high-half data (7654014A). IR registers must sign-expand their16-bit
value; local PsyCross INLINE_C.C MFC2 and the GTE register specification
https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/geometrytransformationenginegte/ agree.
Owner now calls existing MFC2, with15high-sentinel positive/negative IR cases;
normal/sanitizer regression failed beforefix and owner suites pass afterfix.
Corrected source-path tests and natural rerun still pending.

Source remains staged until current instruction-path verification finishes.
No commit/push or goal completion.

The corrected transform fixture also reproduced a pending-load retry defect:
a refused data read at49470 discarded the preceding MFC2 result. Formatter

UBSan independently reported negative translation left shift at upstream
PsyX_GTE.cpp599. tools/prepare_psycross_gte.py now generates a build copy,

All int32 translation inputs fit this operation. CMake and real-GTE fixtures
compile the same generated TU. Counts drift fails closed; focused generator
test passed. The ignored vendor checkout remains unchanged by this work
(existing main/pad edits preserved). No arithmetic implementation replaced.

natural run remain pending; do not use the superseded raw-IR run as proof.

overlay mismatch, or CD word refusal reported. The corrected GTE path returned
through camera callbacks to world initialization and reached the staged
initializer. This replaces the earlier raw-IR run as current runtime evidence.
Existing camera source probe passed a fresh direct rebuild after its stale
IR upper-half expectations were corrected to architectural sign-extension;
assertions and mutation checks were preserved. Final transform baseline passed;
mutation and sanitizer variants still running. No human-visible acceptance.

Final transform suite passed all3variants in166.04s: baseline, wrong output

Read-only audio audit found a concrete hypothesis: queue-capacity skipping
advances sample_index without retiring pending XA frames; consume_pending then
refuses a head sample older than sample_index. The failed log's105sample gap

no queue policy/limit changes or fault suppression made. Earlier failure stays

### SC02 numeric scene callback

Integrated the complete ordinary-C callback [801832F4,80183314), with all
8 retail words, selected SC02 gating, and existing live instruction validation.
Parent pinned rebuild: 8/8 MATCH, SHA256
3607ac82fecc9dd7436f47162a69bff95fdae07afc4e165d5d1c972e9cf9b74b.
SC02/overlay tests: 31 passed; every SC02 exported word is included in the
selector and retail checks. Build session 15505 pending. No registry credit.

Build 15505 passed. Natural callbackreturn run (session23580) terminated
exit2 at **800424E4**, RA80042434, A0=10CB, A1=1, SP801FFFA0.
SOURCE_CLOCK faulted=0; CD DMA3 3170 transfers/2610128 bytes/fault0;
SPU samples=submitted=2051139, queued1275, faulted0. Callback was passed.
However CPU_OWNER reports faulted=1, sequence8990, SR40020404,
kernel_entered1, host_depth0. BIOS_IMAGE and GTE owners report no fault.
800424E4 already has its full39-word export and selector. Therefore this
is NOT established as missing code; CPU runtime/checkpoint diagnosis is the
next gate. No guard widening or replacement export is justified. Original
log preserved; read-only parallel diagnosis dispatched. No human acceptance,
commit, push, or goal completion. No native run remains live.

### CD IRQ callback refusal identified; main C recovery

The callbackreturn log identifies the actual fault: CD_IRQ frame_faulted=1,
instructions=248, call=80045300, target=800377D8, callback slot=800377D8,
kind=01, budget_exhausted=0. The foreground 800424E4 is interrupted here;
it is not a missing export. cd_irq_call rejects this callback target, and the
scheduler propagates that refusal into CPU_OWNER faulted=1. No CPU-status
repair or additional instrumentation is justified. Complete callback recovery
[800377D8,80037CC8) (316 words) is underway alongside contract inspection.

Recovered and integrated complete main8001ABBC C [8001ABBC,8001ACF0).
Parent staged and production rebuilds both match77/77, SHA256
b88da7f15152ace1a493f28edfb569bb9cee02517e714b4d14f29111abf7e79f.
One empty compiler memory barrier is retained; registry deliberately records
mixed recovery, although the automatic classifier treats empty asm as C.
All branches retained. Native word export unchanged. 620 main export tests
pass. This improves source recovery without claiming executable progress past
the IRQ refusal. No commit/push/human acceptance; goal remains active.

### Full sector-transfer IRQ body and contract work

Added exact native-only export [800377D8,80037CC8), 316 words, from pinned
EXE SHA66371c3a7517e9eabd7cb6cf0c5abffe7296bd4bac29c85b8bf7bb9db349714a.
Function SHA256672095aa6fccee963c3af141383ae789c421272709588c8b94639a4ce07e21d1.
Both main and CD IRQ word selectors include the full body. Main export tests:
621 passed. No registry entry or C credit: complete staged C is303 words,
not316, with merged branches/global-load scheduling still unmatched.

The actual callback root is distinct from LIST: return80045308, direct
calls at depth1/SPsaved-70; header43994(800762A0,3), header conversion43B1C,
state1/2/3 sector43994(live80076228,200), then real3C4F0/3C498/3C438 calls.
All descendant bodies already have CD IRQ exports, but contracts remain to be
extended under this exact root. Worker owns cd_irq_call only; separate test
worker owns real CD/DMA fixture and state/negative controls. No native rerun
has occurred; prior callback refusal remains authoritative until verification.

### Bank callback contracts implemented, verification in progress

Added a separate 377D8 callback root in cd_irq_call with live slot/kind,
return/depth/SP, header/payload and real descendant argument checks. Parent
reviewed 3C498's UINT_MAX forwarding and 3C438's unsigned size clamp against
retail words. Continuous CD data-pointer validation now covers this root.
Added existing 26-word 3B0E4 export to CD IRQ word map for four exact SPU
poll-delay call sites. No generic callback admission or CPU fault suppression.

Two genuine polling-timeout diagnostic edges (3A934 and3A9C8 to5C604)
remain refused because no bounded IRQ formatter service exists. Normal-path
contract additions do not prove SPU MMIO or timeout completion. New real
CD/DMA fixture is being debugged; state3 and negative coverage remain pending.
Existing CD IRQ regression session65610 remains live. Build63120 passed before
last CD-word addition; updated build24477 remains live. No new native run.

Bounded C recovery377D8 ended at304 vs316 words (82 positional matches),
with two empty state-register constraints. Full states retained; oracle length
mismatch persists. No promotion or C credit. Prior callbackreturn runtime log
remains the authoritative natural refusal until the next verified run.

Updated build24477 passed. Existing CD IRQ tests session65610 completed:
5 passed in160.88s. New stream fixture independently exercises real CD/DMA
state1 and state2 normal progress/threshold transitions and wrong-header path;
fullstate3 and negative controls remain pending, not implied by those passes.

poll-timeout branch executed, nor human-visible/audible-game acceptance.
Current natural boundary is SC02 801284F0; parallel decomp notified.
Contract-negative and state3 fixture work continue. No commit/push/completion.

State3 fixture's first refusal3A8BC is SHv0,1A8(a0) toSPU FIFO1F801DA8.
Production routing already admits it; real SPU owner requires valid transfer
address and transfer_control4. Fixture omitted source-init3A6D8's control4
write. Test worker corrected that source-backed setup and is rerunning the
same fixture; no production guard change made for this refusal.

Main/SC02/identity checks:652 passed. Callback contract negative test passed
separately (1 test51.27s); it covers contracts, not device execution.

Real PIO state3 fixture subsequently exhausted the original16384 instruction
budget at3B12C after160 FIFOhalfwords, with valid SPU address/control and no
hardware fault. Added a dedicated one-time allowance after the accepted
bank3AE78->3A84C call: (ceil(bytes/64)+1)*70000+2048, bounded to bytes<=7EFF0.
Source uses three fixed delay calls (<1100instructions each) perbatch and
<=F01 polls (<16instructions each), plus stores/control; extra batch covers
initial delay/final poll. Independent review agrees bound fits unsigned
(max569032048). It is selected only within the accepted PIO frame; ordinary
IRQbudget unchanged. PIO exhaustion reports3, no loop replenishment. Fixture
rerun and budget-negative control pending; no success claim yet. The two
poll-timeout formatterdiagnostics remain refused. No new build/naturalrun
since these edits; prior natural801284F0 remains authoritative.

### Glyph parser continuation

Integrated the complete SC02 `80178298` parser (78 words). The production
ordinary C independently matches the pinned member 31 bytes, SHA256
`877e1f8f1fc80ad2f24d89d606edc8d64e55129f8ba2fcd01675a091464bd149`.
The build completed and 31 focused SC02/overlay checks passed. Natural run
`glyphparser` (session 98985) exited 2 at `80176144`, RA `801757CC`,
with CPU, source-clock, CD IRQ, and SPU fault flags clear. No human acceptance.

Rebuilt and verified the complete staged `80176144` routine: 53/53 words,
SHA256 `dca61a9505bbde362796fc44ada9c5364319b34d8cc644480e6675c2416f99a3`.
Integrated its ordinary C and guarded native word export. Validation and
natural continuation are pending. Parallel `80178004` C recovery continues.
No registry credit for unsupported SC02 targets; no commit or push.

The production `80176144` C rebuild also matches 53/53 words. All 31 focused
checks passed, and build session 58559 exited 0. Natural run `scenebuffer`
(session 37821) is now testing the continuation; its result remains pending.

Natural `scenebuffer` session 37821 exited 2 at **80178004**, RA `801761C8`,
A0 `800A53F8`, A1 `00000020`, SP `801FFEC8`. CPU, source-clock, CD IRQ,
and SPU fault flags are all zero. This confirms the next actual callee.
No native run remains live; parallel C recovery of this full routine remains
in progress. Start-screen acceptance is not yet proven.

### Fixed glyph and percentage packets

Integrated the complete retail `80178004` span `[80178004,80178298)`,
165 words, SHA256 `05abbc84e40dd593100f2b2b37c71c8ee71243624095298673e6ad697ec146fd`.
Pinned decoded SC02 member identity was checked before extraction. The full
word export retains all fixed glyphs and numeric-loop branches; C recovery
remains unmatched and continues in parallel. No C or registry credit claimed.
All 31 focused SC02/overlay checks pass. Build session 87893 is pending.

Build 87893 passed. Natural `fixedglyph` session 47641 exited 2 with a
CD IRQ failure: ordinary budget exhausted (`1`) after 16384 instructions,
stop call/target `8003AD08`, callback slot `800377D8`, kind 1. Foreground
CPU boundary is `80034BFC`; CPU and CD IRQ fault flags are set, while
source-clock and SPU flags remain zero. This run does not prove return from
`80178004`. The next action is diagnosis of the exact `8003AB84` polling
path and SPU status behavior, not a foreground export or blanket budget raise.
No native process remains live. Parallel `80178004` bounded matching still
produces 163 versus 165 words; `8016E8F0` recovery is active.

### IRQ diagnosis and parallel recovery

The `fixedglyph` trace shows consecutive SPU transfer-address writes from
`8900` through `9C00` near exhaustion. Current dispatch renews ordinary
allowance for completed LIST callbacks but has no corresponding bank-root
completion renewal. This suggests cumulative productive callbacks, pending
a regression that distinguishes that cause from a stalled poll. No budget
or device semantics changed on this evidence alone.

Independently rebuilt staged SC02 `8016E8F0`: ordinary C matches the full
10-word span `[8016E8F0,8016E918)`, SHA256
`62909794114d0bdb5cf44e589b0854287c52239910b55367f5b2ccdd98940cef`.
The verified scene routine calls it unconditionally after `80175308`; it
calls `80016714(80115218,80)`. It remains staged, without registry credit.
Parallel decompilation now also covers the actual IRQ callee `8003AB84`.

Read-only diagnosis confirms `8003AD08` precedes the first poll read at
`8003AD14`. The last SPUCNT value `C0A1` already has the expected DMA-write
mask `20`; transfer address `9C00` reads back correctly. Owner fault flags
are zero. Thus this stop is cumulative ordinary-budget exhaustion before
the poll, not a demonstrated SPU polling failure. Regression work is assigned
to the stream-fixture owner. Proposed renewal requires a validated bank-root
return, consecutive LBA, starting state 1..3 and final state 1..4; unchanged,
skipped, wrapped, no-op and error paths must not receive renewed allowance.

### Guarded bank completion renewal

Added ordinary-budget renewal only after the accepted bank root returns at
`80045308` with matching stack/depth, initial state 1..3, final state 1..4,
and exactly one consecutive nonwrapping source sector. No renewal occurs
inside a poll or on nested, inactive, failed, repeated or skipped progress.
The dedicated PIO allowance remains separate. New exhaustive state/sector
helper test failed before implementation; it and the existing PIO-renewal
test now pass (2 tests). The first build caught a wrong byte-reader helper
name; corrected to existing `read8`, then build 30092 passed. Natural run
`bankrenewal` session 56196 is live; cumulative stream regression is pending.
No runtime-success claim yet.

Natural `bankrenewal` session 56196 exited 2 at **8016E8F0**, RA `80128508`,
SP `801FFF18`. CPU, CD IRQ, source-clock and SPU fault flags are zero. This
proves natural return through `80178004` and scene-buffer setup for this run.
The next routine is already staged and independently matched 10/10. The
40-sector regression and disabled-renewal control remain pending; do not
call IRQ validation complete from one natural run. No native process live.

### Scene reset and transfer C recovery

Integrated complete SC02 `8016E8F0` (10 words, previously independently
matched) and its guarded word selector. Independently rebuilt both staged
and production main `8003AE14` as ordinary C: 34/34 words, SHA256
`6bff5c136a2f93e8270d73268a1edf786f123746dd2c56e2cc315a492ed4def6`.
Registered the main function as ordinary C; native words are unchanged.
All 33 focused SC02/overlay/renewal checks and 623 main word-export checks
pass. Build 65053 exited 0. Natural `scenereset` session 66449 is live.
The long stream regression remains pending final accounting/control checks.

Natural `scenereset` session 66449 exited 2 at **80175494**, RA `80128524`,
SP `801FFF18`; CPU, CD IRQ, source-clock and SPU fault flags are clear.
`8016E8F0` returned naturally. Recovery of the new actual callee is active.

Direct long-stream baseline passed all 40 immutable sector payload checks
(79,936 SPU bytes) in 4,270,175 instructions. Accounting includes 40 payload
DMAs and 45 header DMAs, five of which are trailing state-4 notifications.
Disabling bank renewal reproduces budget 1; zero PIO allowance triggers
budget 3. Fresh three-variant pytest session 50878 remains pending. This is
a fixture proof using real CD/DMA3/PIO owners and native-style incoming
backpressure, not DMA4 hardware parity or human-visible acceptance.

Fresh stream pytest 50878 exited 0: **3 passed in 167.23s**, including
the 40-sector baseline, disabled bank renewal (ordinary budget 1), and zero
PIO allowance (budget 3). This closes the pending cumulative regression.
Existing IRQ and bank-call contract checks are running as session 62771
(`/tmp/musashi-bank-renewal-irq-regression.log`); no inventory changes
while their generated includes are being prepared. Current natural refusal
remains `80175494`, with complete-span recovery in progress.

Existing IRQ and bank-call contract pytest 62771 exited 0: **6 passed in
216.22s**. Together with the fresh stream controls and progress tests, the
guarded renewal validation is complete for this scope. No general budget
raise or device behavior change was made.

Independently rebuilt staged and production `8003B08C`: ordinary C matches
11/11 words, SHA256 `242f17b75a07920c5870cb5ea38639db348dffb6dd50f72a5f759beb3854f1ac`.
Integrated and registered this actual DMA-write callee; native export bytes
are unchanged. The companion DMA-read routine remains staged only.

### Scene-state setter

Integrated full SC02 `80175494` span `[80175494,801754A8)`: ordinary C,
5/5 words independently rebuilt from staged and production sources, SHA256
`6db536ab23d86792a9456edacbb221c1168e598f5c9d0f01287c38e29423560b`.
The routine sets byte `8011F7A8` to 2 and returns; it has no callees.
All 31 focused SC02/overlay checks pass and build 39174 exited 0.
Natural `statesetter` session 51872 is live. No SC02 registry credit.

Natural `statesetter` session 51872 exited 2 at **8012853C**, RA `801282BC`,
SP `801FFF30`; CPU, CD IRQ, source-clock and SPU fault flags are clear.
Scene setup returned naturally. No native process remains live.

Parallel `801777BC` digit-loop recovery resolved as ordinary C, 59/59 words
with a signed-short digit variable and no assembly constraints. Staged and
production rebuilds independently match SHA256
`0fa2e36925478fcd70f5a30475877df57f8ce80e1ec1511e0fccc63a80380e4e`.
Integrated C; native words unchanged, 31 focused checks pass, no SC02 registry
credit. Recovery continues at actual `8012853C` and earlier called `80177B5C`.

### Scene callback continuation

Integrated full `8012853C` ordinary C, `[8012853C,80128564)`, 10/10
words independently matched from staged and production sources, SHA256
`f22122bad2ecafb086270cf5a033089abe244fb5965b2e4ea77a64b8b7ede42e`.
Calls `80146074` then `80011C10`. The 31 focused checks and build 66710
passed. Natural `scenecallback2` session 85544 is live.

Its unconditional callee `80146074` is independently matched as an empty
return, 2/2 words `[80146074,8014607C)`, SHA256
`6d64edf91449c1b17746c1ef18afa2eb25c70bdf1322ab3df5a2630993b7e2f1`.
It remains staged. These small callbacks do not establish game-engine C
completeness or start-screen acceptance.

Natural `scenecallback2` 85544 exited 2 at `80146074`, RA `8012854C`,
with CPU/CD IRQ/source-clock/SPU fault flags clear. Integrated that complete
empty return; production C also independently matches 2/2 words. The 31
focused checks pass and build 84713 exited 0. Natural `emptycallback`
session 1901 is live. Parallel full `80177B5C` draft improved to 130/147
matching words but remains staged and unmatched, without C credit.

Natural `emptycallback` session 1901 exited 2 at **80128564**, RA `801282BC`,
SP `801FFF30`; CPU/CD IRQ/source-clock/SPU fault flags are clear. Recovery
of the new actual callback is active. No native process remains live.

Full `80177EA4` ordinary C now independently matches 56/56 words from staged
and production sources, SHA256
`d7fb449042e542cb0ac033500bef4b588ad7bbf0fc460385ea10330ca863d134`.
Integrated its C recovery with native words unchanged; 31 focused checks
pass. No SC02 registry credit or start-screen acceptance is claimed.

### Scratchpad-stack callback

Integrated the full retail `80128564` span `[80128564,801285D4)`, 28 words,
SHA256 `b71c659e394e2d7bda30c660ae793eda52600aca1d52f44f03d99d147a91e2ae`,
after checking the pinned decoded SC02 identity. It saves/restores SP via
`1F8003FC`, calls `80178608` on stack `1F8003F8`, conditionally calls
`8002D4C8(6,0)` for scene `300A`, then calls `80011A3C` and stores short 1
at `800B99F2`. The explicit stack-switch routine receives no C credit.
Existing interpreter scratchpad support covers the 1KB address range.
All 31 focused checks and build 76001 passed. Natural `scratchcallback`
session 98471 is live; actual stack-switch execution remains pending.

Natural `scratchcallback` session 98471 exited 2 at **80178608**,
SP `1F8003F8`, RA `8012858C`. CPU/CD IRQ/source-clock/SPU fault flags are
clear. The retail scratchpad stack switch executed naturally; return and
stack restoration remain unobserved until the callee can continue.
No native process remains live. Full callee recovery continues in parallel.

Parallel bounded `80177940` recovery improved its full 101-word candidate
to 40 matching words (previously 14). It remains unmatched and staged,
without production changes or C credit. Its remaining differences are
register allocation and scheduling. Actual `80178608` recovery is active;
no new native run has been started while that full span is established.

### Scratchpad initialization

Integrated full `80178608` ordinary C, `[80178608,8017869C)`, independently
matched from staged and production sources: 37/37 words, SHA256
`db05b9d36e7345e0bd365eb66e36cc8425f983477588d9681428244dbd8a594e`.
It clears two buffers, initializes state, and calls `8013E4B4`. The 31
focused checks and build 7176 pass. Natural `scratchinit` session 13296 is
live. Next callee `8013E4B4` is independently matched 41/41 words, SHA256
`2093ec3ff40c8c16819b72dab3f861b82dd4656b6405cddd7ee1c01ef0b8332d`;
it remains staged with both nullable terminated-array loops preserved.
Parallel `80178004` ordinary draft improved to 164 versus 165 retail words
but remains unmatched and staged. No SC02 registry credit.

Natural `scratchinit` session 13296 exited 2 at **8013E4B4**,
SP `1F8003E0`, RA `8017868C`. CPU/CD IRQ/source-clock/SPU fault flags are
clear. Initialization reached its next callee naturally on the scratchpad
stack. That full callee is verified and staged for integration. No native
process remains live; stack restoration and start-screen acceptance remain
unobserved.

### Entry-array reset

Integrated full `8013E4B4` ordinary C and guarded export, `[8013E4B4,8013E558)`,
41 words. Production independently matches SHA256
`2093ec3ff40c8c16819b72dab3f861b82dd4656b6405cddd7ee1c01ef0b8332d`.
Both nullable 20-byte entry-array loops are retained. All 31 focused checks
and build 30518 pass. Natural `entryreset` session 7810 is live.
Parallel decompilation continues on the earlier called `80176D94`.

Natural `entryreset` session 7810 exited 2 at **8012C750**, entry pointer
A0/S0 `801899A8`, SP `1F8003C8`, RA `8013E4E8`. CPU/CD IRQ/source-clock/SPU
fault flags are clear. The first entry-array loop is active in this run.
No native process remains live; callee recovery is active.

Full `80176D94` mixed C now independently matches 152/152 words from staged
and production sources, SHA256
`2d96f3093eb3d30c8ee0286b72aa4b1f06dfa2984685be9dabe6896141de50e8`.
Integrated recovery retains existing empty compiler constraints, with no
emitted assembly. Native words are unchanged; all 31 focused checks pass.
No SC02 registry credit or human acceptance.

### Entry slot search

Integrated full retail `8012C750` span `[8012C750,8012C820)`, 52 words,
SHA256 `aaba1aa9d53e7fa7446ec324df0da75cd4d454f8764899643559619e551f6757`.
Pinned SC02 identity checked before extraction; both 96-slot search
directions and exhaustion path retained. Ordinary draft was 49 words;
latest mixed draft has 52 words but remains unmatched. No C credit.
Build 28671 and all 31 focused checks pass. Natural `slotsearch` session
83369 is live.

Full `801770E0` mixed C independently matches 152/152 words from staged
and production sources, SHA256
`35097fec875b4f2bce8bc48a96f009f0a89e39389e25ec9ee6014705f8f81300`.
Integrated recovery retains existing constraints, native words unchanged.
No SC02 registry credit or human acceptance.

Natural `slotsearch` session 83369 exited 2 at **8012C890**,
A0 `801899A8`, A1 `801202A0`, SP `1F8003B0`, RA `8012C810`. CPU/CD IRQ/
source-clock/SPU fault flags are clear. The real search selected the first
free slot and reached initialization. Full callee recovery is active; no
native process remains live. Start-screen acceptance is still unproven.

### Allocated-slot initialization

Integrated full retail `8012C890` span `[8012C890,8012CAE4)`, 149 words,
SHA256 `e03de9f7423b47fc7b7c180225c9d58ed74a2d962572b0f18e0ee19714acb9bb`,
after checking pinned decoded SC02 identity. Retained initialization,
indirect callback, failure cleanup, and position-override branches. C
recovery is pending; no credit claimed. All 31 focused checks pass.
Build 79801 is live; the indirect callback target has not yet been observed.

Build 79801 exited 0. Natural `slotinit` session 95703 exited 2 at
**80131FDC**, the real table-selected callback. A0/A1 `801202A0`,
SP `1F800388`, RA `8012C9C4`, V1 `801A8538`. CPU/CD IRQ/source-clock/SPU
fault flags are clear. No callback target or scene state was substituted.
Full recovery continues on initialization and this observed callback.
No native process remains live; start-screen acceptance remains unproven.

### Entry-state dispatch

Integrated full `80131FDC` ordinary C, `[80131FDC,80132018)`, independently
matched from staged and production sources: 15/15 words, SHA256
`d05965cf5bbbde84a1190acd3013c85d2eee9e9142df7f8e9dbd3e9a59193de2`.
Dispatch uses the SC02 table at `801851F8`, not the different MAIN12 table.
All 31 focused checks and build 14912 pass. Natural `entrydispatch`
session 84715 is live; selected target remains to be observed.

Parallel full `8012C890` recovery improved to 147/149 matching words. Two
branch encodings in attached-object cleanup remain different. Full mixed C
stays staged, without exact-match credit or production changes.

Natural `entrydispatch` session 84715 exited 2 at **8013221C**,
A0 `801202A0`, SP `1F800370`, RA `80132008`. CPU/CD IRQ/source-clock/SPU
fault flags are clear. The real state table selected this target; recovery
is active on it. No native process remains live. Start-screen acceptance
and the full scratchpad-stack return remain unproven.

### Starting-level objective and object initialization

The user now explicitly requests reaching the starting level and decompiling
where necessary. Continue the natural retail-backed path; level runtime
acceptance remains unproven. Integrated `8013221C` ordinary C, full 27/27
words independently matched from staged and production sources, SHA256
`c79862b737d8b80531d3248227a537843c741c6eafd843bd77ce53440fc8c28d`.
All 31 focused checks and build 5940 pass. Natural `objectinit` session
80540 is live. Next wrapper `8012C1B8` independently matches 9/9 words,
SHA256 `8a1fae9542cd684d27ba4d6b01f1bc9af2a81930b512d939ed3ec4b7df1631a0`,
and returns `8001CFDC(26,85)` unchanged. It remains staged; recovery of
that main allocator has been assigned in parallel.

Natural `objectinit` session 80540 exited 2 at **8012C1B8**,
A0 `801202A0`, SP `1F800358`, RA `80132230`. CPU/CD IRQ/source-clock/SPU
fault flags are clear. No native process remains live. Both this wrapper
and its unconditional main allocator `8001CFDC` are staged as exact C.
The allocator spans `[8001CFDC,8001D050)`, 29 words, independently matched
against pinned EXE, SHA256
`28c19451b7b52bb603572aaae70206db21ed017ac7b14bf07acf4e1d91f8ba2f`.
It preserves bounds, scan and NULL-result paths. Next action is integration
of these called routines; starting-level runtime acceptance is unproven.

### Record allocation continuation

Integrated verified ordinary C and guarded exports for SC02 `8012C1B8`
(9 words) and main `8001CFDC` (29 words). Both production rebuilds match
the complete pinned spans; main allocator registered as ordinary C, while
SC02 has no registry credit. All 655 focused word/SC02/identity checks pass.
Build 75736 exited 0. Natural `recordallocation` session 46694 is live.
Existing main `8001C214` source is under independent read-only verification
