# Retail startup observation

## Bounded VBlank request observation, 2026-09-05

`tools/retail_vblank_request_observe.lua` observed normal interpreter disc boot
in private profile `/tmp/musashi-vblank-frame-fixed.lyOIrU`. After qualifying
the initialized callback table, it accepted slot-seven entry only from
`ra=80042D38`. The first accepted callback had request index `FFFFFFFF` and
tick `94`. Across 600 accepted callbacks it observed no worker request call.
Exit **2** is the explicit observation-limit result, not a request-chain pass.
No guest input, state injection, or MMIO writes were supplied by the observer.

The final framebuffer is 320 by 240, RGB555, entirely black (all decoded channel
extrema are zero). This is a bounded retail observation; it proves neither a
retail menu nor native startup. The absence of requests in this window does
not establish that the queue is unused later. No request target is inferred.

SHA-256 evidence:

- Observer: `c4774ac3258a1dfe0c23c319bf2cf5aca303d20ef707d99f0201f1614603817e`.
- Private `observer.log`: `59709b737495a3317fed8080d5aaeef391147950659bafb2a4aa38286e18b0af`.
- Private `frame.ppm`: `12c810bd25efe1a7484387cd3d5a8503ce7cc341d61768b99a85c39a0ecca884`.

The preceding profile `/tmp/musashi-vblank-frame.zKF6ag` exited 3 after writing
the same frame: its final logging format rejected the FFI pixel-format enum.
Converting that enum with `tonumber` fixed the reporting failure; the fresh
run above emitted the frame marker and reached the intended exit 2. Preserve
the failed log separately rather than treating it as a successful observer run.

Next native dependency: the recovered parent IRQ dispatcher `800427F4` and
its BIOS context-return boundary. Direct invocation of the VBlank child does
not deliver an interrupt. Nonempty request/completion targets remain unbound
until actual code and execution evidence support them.

## Qualified VBlank callback observation, 2026-09-05

`tools/retail_vblank_observe.lua` completed a fresh normal interpreter disc boot
using the same re-hashed AppRun and BIOS pins documented below. Private profile
`/tmp/musashi-vblank-qualified.gRASof` exited zero after recording the first
nonempty handler's final return-transfer instruction. Observer SHA-256:
`4fd80be9b2a43589b5c1275884df4ec0949e0c187b30da4bb9a28cfdc0e768ba`;
private `observer.log` SHA-256:
`545d168eba700d55be4f192858dd42b2e11f609a6263cd5c9b1a5f9a6c38c36a`.

The observer qualifies initialization through the guard and installed table
targets before accepting handler entry with `ra=800428DC`. This matches the
parent dispatcher's indirect call at `800428D4`. It reads only cached RAM and
CPU registers, supplies no input, and changes no guest state or MMIO.

| Observed visits | Entry tick | Return tick | Enabled bits | Calls |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1, 2, 3 | `0`, `1`, `2` | `1`, `2`, `3` | `0009` | zero; all slots empty |
| 148 | `00000093` | `00000094` | `000D` | slot 7 → `800616D0` |

Visit 148's other seven slots were zero. The indirect-call breakpoint saw both
`v0` and the live slot equal `800616D0`, with tick `94`; the handler subsequently
reached `80042D58` with `ra=800428DC`. This establishes a concrete retail
callback target and its return, not which internal branch or request callback
it took. The preceding ungated capture at `/tmp/musashi-vblank-observe.C3Z3fs`
timed out after breakpoint exceptions; it is rejected as dispatch evidence.

The qualified run ended at that return-transfer instruction. It does not prove
native IRQ scheduling, game callback execution, menu pixels, or menu input.

## Earlier startup observations

A local PCSX-Redux interpreter run booted the registered Musashi disc through
the BIOS and delivered an execution breakpoint at `800141F0`. The observer
reported `MUSASHI_RETAIL_STARTUP_OBSERVED pc=800141f0 cycles=456705331ULL`
and the process exited with code zero. It did not load the EXE directly, set
the PC, inject a return value, or change guest RAM.

The runtime was found outside PATH at
`/home/blizz/Applications/pcsx-redux-src/AppDir/AppRun`, SHA-256
`0621042a2e2d2b4df0f3fd863a11d51be16957303c12f32b44fec2e11e61fa78`.
Its neighboring source checkout reports commit
`3e10093ad9cc2fb445668928b3d0f87abeccd29c`; this does not independently prove
that the binary was built from that checkout. The unpackaged executable has
missing shared libraries; the packaged AppRun executed successfully.

The existing local firmware at
`/var/home/blizz/Projects/xenogears-decomp-ai/disc/scph5500.bin` has SHA-256
`11052b6499e466bbf0a709b1f9cb6834a9418e66680387912451e971cf8a1fef`.
The runtime identifies it as **SCPH-7003 (US)**, regardless of its filename.
It remains in its existing location and is not included in this repository.

The runtime recognized `extracted/disc/disc.cue` as `MUSASHI`, disc ID
`SLUS00726`, and booted `SLUS_007.26;1` at `80010000`, text size `64800` hex,
stack `801FFFF0`. Use the extraction/provenance manifests for disc identity;
labels alone are not an integrity check.

The successful run used:

```sh
/home/blizz/Applications/pcsx-redux-src/AppDir/AppRun \
  --portable /tmp/musashi-retail-runtime.6Z0fgG \
  --cli --testmode --interpreter --debugger \
  --bios /var/home/blizz/Projects/xenogears-decomp-ai/disc/scph5500.bin \
  --iso /var/home/blizz/Projects/brave-fencer-musashi-decomp/extracted/disc/disc.cue \
  --dofile /var/home/blizz/Projects/brave-fencer-musashi-decomp/staging/startup/retail-entry-observe.lua \
  --run
```

The observer is now retained as `tools/retail_startup_observe.lua`; substitute
that path for repeat runs. Create a fresh private directory with `mktemp -d`
for a new portable configuration. The directory above contains only this
task's temporary memory cards. No existing card was used for the disc runs.
An earlier immediate Lua-readiness check loaded the default card paths but
exited before guest execution.

A prior dynarec run booted the disc and printed the retail
`ResetGraph:jtb=80072740,env=80072788` message, but did not deliver this
breakpoint. It was explicitly stopped with SIGINT and exited 255. Use the
interpreter for this observer. GPU unknown-command messages also occurred;
their implications remain unresolved.

Acceptance: retail BIOS-to-startup execution **OBSERVED**. Retail menu pixels,
input, audio, native boot, launcher launch, and human gameplay remain
**NOT_OBSERVED/NOT_RUN**. No menu or device-parity claim follows from entry.

### Retry-exhaustion observation, 2026-09-05

`tools/retail_status_retry_observe.lua` read-only arms `80044198` and exits
only if `D_800763F4` has reached the retail `003C0000` retry threshold. A
fresh interpreter boot ran for 150 seconds after arming without emitting its
threshold record, then the observer process was stopped by the operator
session (exit 255). This is negative timing evidence only: it neither proves
the branch is unreachable nor supplies a native fixture. A real captured frame
is still required before the `8004424C -> 80044250` callback loop is resumed.

The observer was then qualified to log the first `80044198` arrival. It saw
`pc=80044198`, `ra=80044188`, `retry=0`, and `tick=deadline=0` at cycle
`54688849`. The direct `80044190` call would link to `80044198`, so this is an
unqualified/shared arrival and was deliberately rejected as the retry frame.
The run was stopped after recording that fact; it does not establish menu or
CD-status behavior.

The observer now also arms the exact `80044734` call instruction before it
accepts an `80044124` entry. A fresh normal boot again saw only the unrelated
entry at cycle `54687805`; it did not execute `80044734` during the bounded
run. Thus the direct startup-dispatch status call remains **NOT_OBSERVED**;
the `80044124` hit alone is not authority for its live frame.

The observed unrelated `80044124` entry is reached by the `80043B9C`
CD-status worker. Its tracked 354-word assembly is now an exact native bridge
for the no-command return path only; the bridge is not a C decompilation and
does not establish menu progress. Formatter calls and jump-table routes still
stop explicitly pending their retail inputs and C recovery.

### Post-input startup boundary, 2026-09-05

`tools/retail_post_input_observe.lua` arms a read-only execution breakpoint at
`80043300`, but accepts it only with the direct startup caller return address
`800101EC`. An unfiltered normal interpreter boot first reached the same
routine at cycle `253221132` with return address `8003F8F8`; that is a shared
routine use, not the call after `80018918`. A fresh filtered run did not reach
the startup-specific return-address pair during its 55-second limit. This is
negative timing evidence only: it neither disproves later startup execution
nor observes the menu, controller input, or native port.

### Post-startup direct calls, 2026-09-05

`tools/retail_poststart_observe.lua` performed a fresh normal interpreter boot
with a new private portable profile. It observed the direct calls from the
startup loop in order: `8002C8F4` at cycle `543853010`, then `8001971C` at
cycle `543996854`. The run also emitted the retail `ResetGraph:jtb=80072740,
env=80072788` diagnostic before those breakpoints. The script exits at the
second breakpoint, so this proves only that the two registered source bodies
are reached by this retail boot. It does not observe menu pixels, input,
audio, overlay residency, native execution, or launcher behavior.

## Device-query observation

`tools/retail_device_observe.lua` observes normal interpreter boot through the
first mode-zero device query. It checks the order of startup, callback entry,
callback return, query entry, and query return. Intermediate breakpoints read
CPU registers only; the observer never reads MMIO or changes guest state.
The run uses the command above with this observer and private portable
directory `/tmp/musashi-device-observe.RzsqPr`.

Two runs exited zero after observing callback return `v0=8006BAFC` and query
input `a0=0`, returning `v0=0` at `8005C294`. The second run observed:

| PC | Observation before instruction execution |
| --- | --- |
| `8005C1F0` | Masked GPU information in `v0=00000400`; comparison constant `v1=2` |
| `8005C210` | `v0=00002000`, `v1=E1001000`, before the OR instruction |
| `8005C234` | GPU status read result `v0=14802000`, before masking with `1000` |
| `8005C294` | Return value `v0=0`; caller return address `8005BEC4` |

The instructions imply the draw-mode word becomes `E1003000`; that value
is derived from the observed operands, not a separately captured bus write.
The status bit `1000` is clear, explaining the zero return. The observer's
initial log label for `8005C210` was `draw_mode_write_value`; it was corrected
to `draw_mode_before_or` to make the pre-instruction timing explicit.

These are results of this emulator configuration, not a hardware GPU oracle
or permission to hardcode zero in the native query. Unknown GPU-command
messages still occur. CPU cycle counts differed by six between the two runs,
so deterministic timing has not been established. Native device behavior and
full menu execution remain unresolved.

The neighboring emulator source provides a plausible explanation for the
`400` information value: `GPU::init` in `src/core/gpu.cc` initializes
`m_dataRet=0x400`; `CtrlQuery::type` in `src/core/gpu.h` categorizes queries
6 and 7 as `Unknown`; `GPU::write1(CtrlQuery*)` has no update for that type.
This is consistent with a retained latch after the game's query 7, rather
than a hardware GPU identification response. Binary-to-source provenance is
not established, so this remains a source-supported explanation, not proof
of the packaged binary's implementation. Query 7 is an unresolved authority
boundary for native device emulation.

## Callback table observation

`tools/retail_callback_observe.lua` snapshots cached RAM at initializer entry
`80042718` and its return epilogue `800427E0`. Normal interpreter disc boot
with private portable directory `/tmp/musashi-callback-observe.jMiaUs`
completed both snapshots and exited zero. The table pointer remained
`8006CB64`, and the return value was `8006BAFC`.

| State | Entry | Return |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Guard at `8006BAFC` | `0000` | `0001` |
| Saved-stack word at `8006BB38` | `00000000` | `8006CB14` |
| Table slot `+04` | `00000000` | `80042F8C` |
| Table slot `+14` | `00000000` | `80042D60` |

Slots `+00/+08/+0C/+10/+18/+1C` remained
`80073524/800429DC/80042718/80042B30/80042BDC/8006BAFC` respectively.
Only cached RAM and registers were read; no device reads or guest writes were
introduced by the observer. These observations establish this boot's installed
state, not complete callback semantics or native compatibility.

The installer returning slot `+14`'s target, `80042C90`, is now recovered in
`src/main/80042c90.c`: all 22 words match retail (88 bytes), SHA-256
`87f8f4479d400385fbcb08dabd9daceaa2172d0a34aaa7413934db07a45bdad0`.
Its MMIO write and remaining callback dependencies are not yet native-bound.

The registration wrapper `800425B0` and handler `80042CE8` are also recovered
in `src/main/800425b0.c` and `src/main/80042ce8.c`:

- `800425B0`: 48 bytes, 12/12 words, SHA-256
  `bbf8602f754b9d7659b34dc66ce96bf1554001c6c154b6d38fc0d290d67340ae`.
  It forwards both arguments through table slot `+08`; the observed target
  `800429DC` is still an indirect dependency.
- `80042CE8`: 120 bytes, 30/30 words, SHA-256
  `d3914404d3789d86214634224413c1cd38ef8ab774c079928e1f9690d5835be5`.
  It increments the counter at `8006CBB8` and reads eight callback slots in
  order, invoking nonzero entries. The source uses an unsigned counter for
  defined wrap and volatile access to reproduce the observed extra load.

The isolated host test executes the actual handler source and verifies counter
wrap before callbacks, null slots, exactly eight slots, and a callback replacing
a later slot during dispatch. Host pointers in that test are not a guest-memory
binding. Registration, interrupts, and native startup remain open.

An extended callback observer completed normal boot through the two startup
registration calls, exiting zero. Slot addresses are based at `8006BB00`:

| Index | Installed callback | Previous / return value | Cached enabled bits before → after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `80042CE8` | `00000000` | `0000 → 0001` |
| 3 | `80042E08` | `00000000` | `0001 → 0009` |

The enabled bits are the cached halfword at `8006BB2C`; the observer did not
read the hardware interrupt mask. Both slots contained the installed callback
at return, and the original callback-table/guard observations were reproduced.

The registration body spans `[800429DC,80042B30)` (340 bytes), crossing the
disassembly label `80042A40`. That interior label is not an independently
callable C routine: execution falls through into it with live registers from
`800429DC`. The older banked draft failed because it omitted this continuation.
`staging/startup/800429dc-register.c` now covers the complete body, including
same-value and uninitialized-guard returns, temporary interrupt-mask clearing,
slot/bitmap changes, BIOS calls for indices 0/4/5/6, and mask restoration.
It compiles to 348 bytes and remains unmatched/unregistered. No native
registration implementation has been substituted for it.
